MeridianLink, Inc.'s (NYSE:MLNK) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 42% Above Its Share Price

Key Insights
Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, MeridianLink fair value estimate is US$32.81
Current share price of US$23.06 suggests MeridianLink is potentially 30% undervalued
Analyst price target for MLNK is US$24.58 which is 25% below our fair value estimate
Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of MeridianLink, Inc. (NYSE:MLNK) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.
Check out our latest analysis for MeridianLink
The Model
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:

("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$852m
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$163m× (1 + 2.6%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.6%) = US$3.4b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.4b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$1.6b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.5b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$23.1, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 30% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
NYSE:MLNK Discounted Cash Flow December 12th 2024
The Assumptions
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at MeridianLink as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.201. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
SWOT Analysis for MeridianLink
Strength
No major strengths identified for MLNK.
Weakness
Interest payments on debt are not well covered.
Opportunity
Forecast to reduce losses next year.
Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.
Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.
Threat
Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.
Next Steps:
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For MeridianLink, we've compiled three important aspects you should consider:

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
MeridianLink shares have lost about 2.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 24.3%.
What's Next for MeridianLink?
While MeridianLink has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for MeridianLink: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.08 on $79.36 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.27 on $315.43 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Technology Services is currently in the top 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
One other stock from the same industry, Telus International (TIXT), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2024. The results are expected to be released on November 8.
This digital services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.02 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -90.5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
Telus International's revenues are expected to be $650.1 million, down 2% from the year-ago quarter.

Operational Measures Definitions
We reference bookings, which is an internal operational measure of the business. Bookings is defined as the total of the minimum annual contracted value for newly sold capabilities of our software-as-a-service, or SaaS, products over a given time period, inclusive of any corresponding vendor fees owed to Third Parties.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the financial measures presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin; non-GAAP operating income (loss); non-GAAP net income (loss); non-GAAP cost of revenue; non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses; non-GAAP research and development expenses; non-GAAP general and administrative expenses; and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Rather, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported GAAP financial results, provide investors with additional meaningful information to assess our financial performance and trends, enable comparison of financial results between periods, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics utilized internally in analyzing and operating our business. The following definitions are provided:
Non-GAAP operating income (loss): GAAP operating income (loss), excluding the impact of share-based compensation, employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, expenses associated with our secondary offering, restructuring related costs, expenses related to debt modification, charges in connection with litigation unrelated to our core business, and expenses for services performed by a third party consultant relating to efforts to remediate our material weakness.
Non-GAAP net income (loss): GAAP net income (loss), excluding the impact of share-based compensation, employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, expenses associated with our secondary offering, restructuring related costs, expenses related to debt modification, charges in connection with litigation unrelated to our core business, expenses for services performed by a third party consultant relating to efforts to remediate our material weakness, and the effect of income taxes, including the partial valuation allowance, on non-GAAP items. The effects of income taxes on non-GAAP items reflect a fixed long-term projected tax rate of 24%.

The Company employs a structural long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate of 24% for greater consistency across reporting periods, eliminating effects of items not directly related to the Company's operating structure that may vary in size and frequency. This long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate is determined by analyzing a mix of historical and projected tax filing positions, assumes no additional acquisitions during the projection period or include the impact from the partial deferred tax asset valuation allowance, and takes into account various factors, including the Company’s anticipated tax structure, its tax positions in different jurisdictions, and current impacts from key U.S. legislation where the Company operates. We will reevaluate this tax rate, as necessary, for significant events such as significant alterations in the U.S. tax environment, substantial changes in the Company’s geographic earnings mix due to acquisition activity, or other shifts in the Company’s strategy or business operations.
Adjusted EBITDA: net income (loss) before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, expenses associated with our secondary offering, restructuring related costs, expenses related to debt modification, charges in connection with litigation unrelated to our core business, expenses for services performed by a third party consultant relating to efforts to remediate our material weakness, and deferred revenue reductions from purchase accounting for acquisitions prior to the adoption of ASU 2021-08, "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers," which we early adopted on January 1, 2022 on a prospective basis. Deferred revenue from acquisitions prior to the adoption of ASU 2021-08 was recognized on a straight line basis through December 31, 2023.
Non-GAAP cost of revenue: GAAP cost of revenue, excluding the impact of share-based compensation, employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, and amortization of developed technology.
Non-GAAP operating expenses: GAAP operating expenses, excluding the impact of share-based compensation, employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, expenses associated with our secondary offering, expenses related to debt modification, charges in connection with litigation unrelated to our core business, expenses for services performed by a third party consultant relating to efforts to remediate our material weakness, and depreciation and amortization, as applicable.
Free cash flow: GAAP cash flow from operating activities less GAAP purchases of property and equipment (Capital Expenditures) and capitalized costs related to developed technology (Capitalized Software).
Reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures are available in the accompanying schedules, which are posted as part of this earnings release on our website. No reconciliation is provided with respect to certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures as the GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis. We cannot reliably predict all necessary components or their impact to reconcile such financial measures without unreasonable effort. The events necessitating a non-GAAP adjustment are inherently unpredictable and may have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results.

(1) Litigation-related charges pertains to litigation settlements and related legal fees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $1.5 million related to estimated settlements of class action lawsuits and $0.4 million related to third-party legal fees directly related to the settlements. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $0.2 million gain on a favorable litigation settlement. The gain was recognized in interest and other income on our condensed consolidated statements of operations.
(2) Restructuring related costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are inclusive of net acceleration (forfeitures) of share-based compensation associated with restructuring in the amount of $0.0 million and ($0.7 million), respectively.
(3) Expenses for services performed by a third party consultant related to efforts to remediate our previously identified material weakness.
(4) The amounts presented for the periods ended September 30, 2023 in our reconciliation of net loss to Non-GAAP net income are corrected from our previously disclosed Non-GAAP net income for those periods. The previously disclosed income tax effects on non-GAAP items for the periods ended September 30, 2023 were inadvertently expressed as positive numbers, where such figures should have been expressed as negative numbers.

Positive Points
MeridianLink Inc (NYSE:MLNK) reported a strong second quarter with GAAP revenue of $78.7 million, marking a 4% growth year-over-year.
The company achieved an adjusted EBITDA of $31.8 million, representing a 40% EBITDA margin, meeting the high end of their guidance range.
MeridianLink Inc (NYSE:MLNK) successfully repriced its existing $426 million term loan, reducing interest expense by approximately 51 basis points.
The company continues to see strong demand for its MeridianLink One platform, particularly in digital lending solutions.
MeridianLink Inc (NYSE:MLNK) has a robust cross-sell strategy, with significant wins in expanding share of wallet within its existing customer base.
Negative Points
MeridianLink Inc (NYSE:MLNK) is facing macroeconomic headwinds, including multi-year lows in auto lending and generational lows in mortgage volumes.
The company experienced a downtick in customer counts, with net churn being a concern, particularly among smaller clients.
Mortgage-related revenue within lending software solutions declined 13% year-over-year due to customer churn and strength in the year-ago quarter.
Data verification software solutions revenue declined 13% year-over-year, driven by a significant down-sell of a large customer.
Community banks and credit unions are facing lower deposit flows, impacting loan volume growth and constraining MeridianLink Inc (NYSE:MLNK)'s growth.
Q & A Highlights
Q: Can you elaborate on the drivers behind the mid to upper-single digit outlook for non-mortgage lending software solutions? A: Larry Katz, CFO, explained that the growth is primarily driven by ACV release, which is a result of strong pipeline and bookings. While there is some contribution from improved service execution, the main factor is the successful go-to-market strategy translating bookings into revenue, despite some volume headwinds.
Q: What are the demand trends for account opening solutions, and are there any additional investments planned for this product? A: Nicolaas Vlok, CEO, noted strong demand for account opening solutions, both from existing customers and new logos. MeridianLink continues to invest in user experience, digital front-end, and partner integrations to enhance the account opening process, making it faster and more automated.
Q: With recent leadership changes, are there any expected changes to the company's structure or go-to-market strategy? A: Nicolaas Vlok, CEO, stated that no major changes are anticipated. Larry Katz's new role will encompass the entire commercial part of the business, including services and support, aiming for efficiency gains and a seamless customer journey.
Q: How are sales trends differing between banks and credit unions, and between existing customers and new logos? A: Nicolaas Vlok, CEO, mentioned that new logo sales are slower due to longer deal cycles, but cross-sell with existing customers remains strong. Credit unions make up two-thirds of the customer base, with banks comprising one-third. There are more compliance discussions with banks, but overall, both segments are showing improvement.
Q: What is the expected impact of potential interest rate cuts on mortgage and non-mortgage lending? A: Larry Katz, CFO, indicated that rate cuts are a leading indicator of demand. While mortgage volumes are responsive to rate changes, auto lending is more affected by used car prices and balance sheet liquidity. The impact of rate cuts on volumes will be gradual, with mortgage showing more immediate responsiveness.

Investors Could Be Concerned With MeridianLink's (NYSE:MLNK) Returns On Capital
editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St)
November 10, 2024 2 min read
In This Article:
MLNK
-0.21%
What financial metrics can indicate to us that a company is maturing or even in decline? Typically, we'll see the trend of both return on capital employed (ROCE) declining and this usually coincides with a decreasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately this means that the company is earning less per dollar invested and on top of that, it's shrinking its base of capital employed. So after glancing at the trends within MeridianLink (NYSE:MLNK), we weren't too hopeful.
Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on MeridianLink is:
Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)
0.018 = US$16m ÷ (US$968m - US$72m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).
So, MeridianLink has an ROCE of 1.8%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Software industry average of 9.1%.
See our latest analysis for MeridianLink
NYSE:MLNK Return on Capital Employed November 10th 2024
In the above chart we have measured MeridianLink's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for MeridianLink .
What Does the ROCE Trend For MeridianLink Tell Us?
We are a bit worried about the trend of returns on capital at MeridianLink. Unfortunately the returns on capital have diminished from the 6.0% that they were earning four years ago. On top of that, it's worth noting that the amount of capital employed within the business has remained relatively steady. Companies that exhibit these attributes tend to not be shrinking, but they can be mature and facing pressure on their margins from competition. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on MeridianLink becoming one if things continue as they have.
The Bottom Line
In the end, the trend of lower returns on the same amount of capital isn't typically an indication that we're looking at a growth stock. And long term shareholders have watched their investments stay flat over the last three years. That being the case, unless the underlying trends revert to a more positive trajectory, we'd consider looking elsewhere.
On a final note, we've found 1 warning sign for MeridianLink that we think you should be aware of.
While MeridianLink isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.

Deluxe (DLX) Beats Q3 Earnings Estimates
Zacks Equity Research
November 7, 2024 3 min read
In This Article:
MLNK
-0.21%
Deluxe (DLX) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.84 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.72 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.79 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 16.67%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this payments and data company would post earnings of $0.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.86, delivering a surprise of 32.31%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.
Deluxe , which belongs to the Zacks Business - Office Products industry, posted revenues of $528.4 million for the quarter ended September 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.06%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $537.8 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Deluxe shares have lost about 10.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.2%.
What's Next for Deluxe?
While Deluxe has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Deluxe: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.77 on $528.3 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.11 on $2.14 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Business - Office Products is currently in the bottom 25% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
MeridianLink (MLNK), another stock in the broader Zacks Business Services sector, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2024. The results are expected to be released on November 7.
This provider of cloud-based software services for financial institutions is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
MeridianLink's revenues are expected to be $79.54 million, up 4% from the year-ago quarter.
