However, when multiple insiders purchase stock, like in Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation's (NYSE:MX) instance, it's good news for shareholders. While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Magnachip Semiconductor The Last Months Of Insider Transactions At Magnachip Semiconductor In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when CEO & Director Young-Joon Kim bought USk worth of shares at a price of US per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US). It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. While Magnachip Semiconductor insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!

Insider Ownership Of Magnachip Semiconductor Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Insiders own of Magnachip Semiconductor shares, worth about USm, according to our data. Overall, this level of ownership isn't that impressive, but it's certainly better than nothing! So What Do The Magnachip Semiconductor Insider Transactions Indicate? The fact that there have been no Magnachip Semiconductor insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. We'd like to see bigger individual holdings. However, we don't see anything to make us think Magnachip Semiconductor insiders are doubting the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

      "content": "Why Is Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation (MX) Among the Semiconductor Penny Stocks To Invest In Right Now? Ramish Cheema November , min read In This Article: MX - We recently compiled a list of the Best Semiconductor Penny Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation (NYSE:MX) stands against the other semiconductor penny stocks. With the age of artificial intelligence having made an indelible mark on the stock market, semiconductor stocks have been thrust into the spotlight. While it's typically the stocks at the top of the semiconductor food chain, such as the AI GPU designer whose shares are up since ChatGPT was made public or the Taiwanese contract chip manufacturer responsible for making AI GPUs or processors for Apple, that catch the media and public attention, the semiconductor industry is made of a plethora of other firms as well. Broadly speaking, the semiconductor industry comprises firms upstream and downstream of the chip supply chain. Starting from the former category, these semiconductor stocks start from those that provide design intellectual properties and hardware used to manufacture chips. Moving further downstream, semiconductor fabrication firms such as the Taiwanese firm whose American Depository Receipts (ADRs) have gained since ChatGPT's public unveiling started to play a role. Finally, the downstream chip supply chain is made of designers who sell the products and others who assemble chips into the hardware needed for their proper functioning. To invest in semiconductor stocks, an investor needs to know which supply chain category a stock belongs to. This is because industry dynamics often have a varying effect on stocks at different rungs of the supply chain. Additionally, when we talk about downstream stocks, then the markets that they cater to also play a role in the share price performance. Stocks that are upstream are affected by broader industry trends and find it difficult to benefit from sector-specific tailwinds such as artificial intelligence. As an illustration, consider the performance of three upstream semiconductor stocks. The first stock ranks th on the list of AI stocks shaping Wall Street, the second is th on Goldman Sachs' list of top growth investors, while the third ranked th and was losing popularity among institutional investors according to Bank of America. The first two stocks are up and over the past twelve months while the third is up by a more modest . Compared to the Philadelphia semiconductor stock index, a widely followed industry benchmark that has gained over the same period, all three semiconductor stocks have underperformed. A brief look at the three stocks' business model sheds light on the reasons behind their lackluster performance. Starting from the worst stock whose shares are up by . The firm provides semiconductor manufacturing equipment such as those used in wafer cleaning, etching, and film deposition. This means that it has exposure to the broader and non-AI sectors of the downstream semiconductor industry as well. Additionally, during its fiscal year , of the firm's revenue came from the memory industry. These chips run parallel with integrated circuits in computers, and their demand has been depressed recently and only started to recover in mid-. It also has exposure to China, and semiconductor tensions between the US and China haven't boded well for the stock either. Similarly, the semiconductor stock that is up over the past year also has notable exposure to China. During the nine months ending in July , of its revenue came from China. Yet, for the three months ending in July, this percentage dropped to as US government restrictions against American chip firms from supplying products to China continued to affect it. This semiconductor firm provides products such as plasma abatement systems, epitaxy systems, film deposition systems, and etching masks. As a result, even if there are no US-Chinese tensions, the fact that China's economy and industrial production have slowed naturally reduces the demand for its products. On the downstream end of the semiconductor supply chain, there is a clear bifurcation between AI and non-AI stocks, or those with exposure to integrated circuits and GPUs, and those with no exposure. To understand how to consider two stocks of firms that manufacture semiconductors. The first is the Taiwanese firm which we've mentioned above. Its ADRs are up year-to-date. The second ranks th on our BofA list shared above, and its shares are down year-to-date. Starting from the former, during the third quarter, of the firm's revenue came from high-performance computing (HPC) products. These chips are involved in data centers, enterprise computing, and other workloads, and they also have wide exposure to the artificial intelligence industry. This firm also manufactures AI GPUs for Wall Street's favorite GPU designer, and the culmination of its end markets coupled with the fact that its -nanometer manufacturing process is an industry leader has seen investor optimism surge surrounding its fortunes. On the flip side, the semiconductor stock whose shares are down has little exposure to HPC and AI chips. As of H , of the firm's billion revenue came through products that it sold to the automotive industry. This firm is known for selling chips manufactured through silicon carbide. These chips are used to manage power in electric vehicles, and as EV demand has slowed down in , investors have fled the stock in response. The semiconductor stock hasn't been helped by the fact that slowing industrial activity led to a industrial revenue drop during H. As should be clear by now, semiconductor stocks come in all flavors. One such flavor, when analyzing them through share prices, is the penny stock segment. These stocks belong to smaller companies that do not have sizable revenue to power their valuation. Yet, penny stocks, when prudently considered, also often have the chance for stronger returns due to their low prices. On the flip side, these stocks are prone to market manipulation, and since they're not as frequently covered by analysts or the media, understanding the fundamental drivers of their share price is complex. With these details in mind, let's take a look at some semiconductor penny stocks. Our Methodology To make our list of the best semiconductor penny stocks, we ranked semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks under by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q and picked out the top stocks. Why are we interested in stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned since May , beating its benchmark by percentage points. (see more details here). A technician using a microscope to inspect a complex semiconductor structure. Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation (NYSE:MX) Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q : Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation (NYSE:MX) is a South Korean semiconductor firm that focuses on making and selling chips used in consumer-oriented products such as displays and smartphones. As of H , of the firm's revenue came from selling analog devices that are used in power management. These products are used in industrial and consumer applications, and a sluggish Asian economy has meant that Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation (NYSE:MX) has struggled and its shares are down . This weakness has been pronounced particularly due to the firm's reliance on ex-Korea Asia Pacific revenue which accounted for of its H sales and marked an annual drop. Therefore, a recovery in the Asian economy and China should drive the hypothesis and create tailwinds for the shares. Another key aspect for firms like Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation (NYSE:MX) is their channel inventory. Here's what management shared on this front during the Q earnings call: \"The Industrial segment continued to see a strong rebound in solar. The issues of excess distributor and customer inventory in China now is behind us in this business segment. In addition to solar inverters, demand for solar pumps are expanding the range of applications we address. The Industrial segment also saw growth from additional design wins in the China lighting market with our sixth-generation Super-Junction devices. Finally, the shift to high-speed e-motors for scooters and motorcycles is leading to an increase in Bill-of-Material content and carries the potential for stronger growth. While a relatively smaller contributor to PAS, the Automotive segment continues to show strength. We are building upon our past success in Korea with additional design wins and production ramps for automotive customers in Japan and China.\" Overall MX ranks st on our list of the semiconductor penny stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of MX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

After the latest inflation numbers showed an unnerving rise in prices, President Donald Trump posted on social media, \"Biden inflation up!\" Biden left office on January , and the latest inflation report was for January. So, in a way, it was the final inflation reading of the Biden administration. Trump deserves a grace period. On the other hand, Trump did say while campaigning last year, \"when I win, I will immediately bring prices down. Starting on day one.\" He hasn't. So Democrats are in his grille, bashing Trump about eggsploding egg prices caused by avian flu and scores of eggsecutive orders Trump has signed having nothing to do with lowering inflation. It's silly to argue over who's responsible for inflation one month after a new president takes office. Trump didn't cause bird flu any more than Biden did, and any president has far less control over prices than voters like to think. But Bidenflation vs. Trumpflation is a preview of a more serious problem Trump could face in coming months. Inflation is getting worse, not better, and Trump can't blame Biden forever. If the trend continues, voters will start blaming Trump for inflation, and one lesson of Biden's presidency is that voters vexed by rising prices can be unforgiving. The inflation rate dropped from a high of in to last September. It looked like the problem was nearly solved, and the Federal Reserve started cutting short-term interest rates as a sign it expected inflation to settle back near its target of or so. But since then, inflation has ticked back up, and it's now up to . Prices in a grab bag of categories, including insurance, used cars, airfares, and rent, remain sticky-high. Ten-dollar eggs are the new gasoline, a shocking price for a staple that reminds shoppers of inflation with every trip to the store. Haunting Trump: Former US President Joe Biden during a farewell event with staff at Joint Base Andrews in Suitland, Md., on Jan. , . (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images) · The Washington Post via Getty Images Worse for Trump, consumers expect his economic policies to make inflation worse, not better. As he promised, Trump has made tariffs on imports the centerpiece of his economic agenda, with new customs duties on some imports already imposed and more on the way. Surveys clearly show that Americans expect Trump's tariffs to raise prices. In the University of Michigan's monthly survey, respondents said they expect inflation in one year to be , with the outlook getting progressively worse during the past couple of months. Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Bluesky, or sign up for his newsletter. Something has to give. If inflation is a problem six months from now, hardly anybody is going to think it's Biden's fault. Trump will have to either back away from many of his tariff threats or simply tell voters they're stuck with higher prices. Trump does have plausible off-ramps for most of his tariff threats. Since he can largely impose them unilaterally, he can remove them unilaterally. During his first term, Trump claimed tariffs were meant to lower the US trade deficit, which created a high barrier for Trump to claim success, given that those trade deficits didn't drop very much. This time around, Trump has set squishier goals as the purpose of his trade wars, such as help from foreign nations curbing illegal immigration or more favorable terms for US exports. That makes it easier for Trump to declare victory and say tariffs won't be necessary after all. How long will he wait? It may depend on how bad inflation gets. Most economists don't think we'll see inflation again anytime soon. Inflation could stay slightly elevated at around , or approach in a downside scenario. It's an open question whether egg prices or some other anomalous shock will have an outsized effect on consumer psyches and convince people inflation is worse than it is. Another variable is that many Americans, after three years of unusual price hikes, have inflation fatigue and are especially sensitive to any further price hikes. Trump seems confident that inflation won't vex him the way it did Biden. His early actions, instead of battling inflation, focus on deregulation, eradicating cultural sensitivity policies, curbing illegal immigration, and even reviving plastic straws. Maybe Trump thinks voters will forever associate Biden with inflation and him with the cure. Biden, however, won't be on the ballot in the next election.

Claire Boston · Senior Reporter Updated Sat, February , at : AM EST min read Borrowers who got home loans through government-backed programs are increasingly falling behind on their payments, a potentially worrying signal for how lower-income Americans are faring in today’s economy. Delinquency rates on Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Affairs loans reached and , respectively, at the end of last year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, breaching pre-pandemic levels. While FHA and VA loans don’t have income restrictions, they’re insured by the government and have looser down payment and credit score requirements than conventional mortgages, making them popular among borrowers with dinged credit or lower incomes. Learn more: Types of FHA loans: Your options and how to choose a program Conventional mortgage delinquencies are creeping up too, but much more slowly. At , they remain below pre-pandemic levels and near historical lows. The divergence in that data likely reflects the extra economic pressures lower-income borrowers have faced in recent years, in particular high home prices, inflation, and the rapidly rising interest rates designed to address it. “While the Fed is cutting rates, and that’s helped lift asset prices a little bit, those on the lower-income household side are not feeling any benefit,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING. “Their borrowing costs are not going down. If anything, they’ve been going up, and we still have sticky inflation that’s eating into spending power.” January Consumer Price Index data showed prices up from a year earlier, well above the Federal Reserve’s goal. The Fed cut interest rates three times in late amid signs that inflation was easing and the job market was weakening, but is now on pause as inflation shows signs of persistence. Traders are now expecting a single rate cut this year. Gradual rise in delinquencies on the way? The reasons consumers fall behind on their mortgages vary. About a quarter of FHA borrowers who were seriously delinquent — meaning they were more than three months behind on their payments — cited loss of income, followed by who blamed excessive debt. Private mortgage lending to subprime borrowers all but dried up after the financial crisis, and FHA loans provide the closest proxy today. Even in the best economic times, delinquency rates on these loans are typically several times higher than on conventional loans. “It is a very different borrower profile,” said Andy Walden, vice president of enterprise research strategy at ICE Mortgage Technology. “It was kind of expected that this would happen in this FHA section first because those are the borrowers that are typically impacted first when the broader economy changes. I think you’ll see a gradual rise in delinquencies outside of that.” Higher-income consumers have fared well in recent years because they're more likely to have invested in the stock market and benefited from several strong years of gains, plus they spend a smaller portion of their incomes on essentials like groceries. But what starts as a stressor for less well-off borrowers can often spread, particularly if the job market weakens generally. In a recent report, ICE said FHA and VA loan delinquencies “are likely to serve as canaries in the coal mine” for broader mortgage payment trends during this economic cycle. Rikard Bandebo, chief economist for VantageScore, has been eyeing growing delinquencies among the high-income group his credit-scoring company tracks. Those earners, who make over a year, are now falling behind on their mortgages, car loans, and credit cards at a relatively faster rate than households bringing in less than annually. “The costs of inflation are really beginning to hit them now,” Bandebo said, adding that while this group might not have felt the sting of higher grocery costs, they’re still getting squeezed by ballooning expenses on things like car payments, insurance, and school tuition. Even as more consumers feel squeezed, today’s delinquencies among all types of borrowers remain far below levels seen during the financial crisis and the pandemic lockdowns of . “We’re coming up off of a really low level,” said Molly Boesel, senior principal economist at data provider CoreLogic. And homeowners are generally in a far better financial position than they were during the housing crisis — stricter mortgage underwriting and strong home price appreciation in recent years mean very few borrowers are underwater on their purchases. Still, Boesel said she’s monitoring where in the country borrowers are paying late. CoreLogic found that delinquencies are rising in of metro areas, suggesting a more widespread problem that can’t be explained by single destabilizing events like natural disasters. Right now, exactly when a borrower got their loan also matters. Those who purchased in or earlier, when mortgage rates were near all-time lows and home prices hadn’t yet hockey-sticked higher, have much lower debt-to-income ratios and healthier equity positions than those who bought in or , said Walden, of ICE. Read more: How do you qualify for a home equity loan? Given how much harder it’s become to afford a home, recent borrowers are going delinquent early in their loans at higher rates than those who bought a few years earlier, even though underwriting standards haven’t changed. Higher prices and mortgage rates also mean they build equity at a slower pace. “It’s a night-and-day difference,” Walden said. “Lenders aren’t stretching to make risky mortgages, but it’s a very different dynamic in terms of equity.” Claire Boston is a Senior Reporter for Yahoo Finance covering housing, mortgages, and home insurance.

      "content": "As he targets the CFPB, Elon Musk looks to dismantle his own potential regulator The consumer watchdog would have oversight of X if it becomes a platform for processing digital payments. Jordan Weissmann Updated Sat, February , at : PM EST min read Elon Musk has spent years laying the groundwork to transform X into a digital payments platform. Now he appears to be helping dismantle the agency that would oversee it. Over the weekend, the Trump administration ordered a halt to effectively all work at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the regulator that ensures companies like large banks, mortgage lenders, student loan servicers, and online payment apps don’t bilk their customers. It also barred employees from showing up to the agency’s Washington, D.C., headquarters this week, apparently following the playbook it used to rapidly shut down USAID earlier this month. Musk seemed to signal those moves were imminent on Friday afternoon, tweeting “CFPB RIP” just hours after members of his Department of Government Efficiency — aka DOGE — set up shop at the agency. “They did above zero good things, but still need to go,” he added later. Many Republicans have opposed the CFPB since its creation as part of ’s Dodd-Frank financial reforms and have often called for its closure, arguing that Washington has too many redundant regulators. The agency has also clashed with Silicon Valley in recent years, such as when it forced LendUp, an online payday lender, to stop doing new business. Musk first tweeted that it was time to “delete CFPB” in November, after one of LendUp’s backers, the billionaire venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, harshly criticized the agency on a podcast. A security officer works inside of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) building headquarters Monday, Feb. , , in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) · ASSOCIATED PRESS But critics have noted that if the CFPB is mothballed, Musk also may stand to personally benefit. “He’s not just looking at government efficiency,” said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, a conglomerate of nonprofits supporting strong regulations. “He’s clearing the way for his company to avoid regulation.” The billionaire has long talked about his desire to elevate X from a social media platform into an all-encompassing “everything app,” where consumers can also hold their cash, make payments, and shop, similar to China’s Weibo. The company made major strides toward that goal by acquiring money-transmitter licenses in states plus the District of Columbia, and last month announced a new deal with Visa that will eventually allow it to offer a digital wallet. As a result, X would likely come under the CFPB’s oversight. Late last year, the agency finalized rules establishing its authority to supervise digital payment apps that handle more than million transactions. It has also brought enforcement actions against payment platforms like CashApp and the group that runs Zelle for failing to adequately deal with fraud on their networks. Read more: Is it safe to store money in apps like Venmo, PayPal, and Cash App? “Musk does not want an active CFPB that will make sure that [X] is following the rules, that it is not ripping off consumers,” said Patrick Woodall, managing director of policy at Americans for Financial Reform, a group that advocates stricter regulations in the financial services industry. Federal conflict of interest laws bar special government employees like Musk from working on matters where they may have a direct financial stake. But last week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it would be up to the tech magnate to decide when to recuse himself from a matter. “If Elon Musk comes across a conflict of interest with the contracts and the funding that DOGE is overseeing, then Elon will excuse himself from those contracts,” she said. “And he has, again, abided by all applicable laws.” A Trump administration spokesman did not respond to a request for further comment on Musk’s potential conflict of interest on Monday or about its plans for the CFPB. For now, the agency is being directly run by Russell Vought, Trump’s Office of Management and Budget head, who issued this weekend’s stop-work order freezing all of CFPB’s supervision, enforcement, and regulatory work. Whether Trump officials will eventually seek to put the agency into long-term hibernation or keep it operating with a bare-bones workforce, remains to be seen. (A federal employees union has sued to undo Vought’s work pause). But even just diminishing the CFPB could free companies like X from layers of federal scrutiny. For instance, the agency may have fewer resources to conduct day-to-day supervision, where staff check to make sure firms are following consumer protection laws. “The thing about supervision is it’s the checkup along the way,” said Rust. “You don’t know there’s a problem unless you check. And it looks like we’re not going to be checking for a little while.” Even with the CFPB sidelined, X’s payments app could still face oversight from state attorneys general, who are empowered under Dodd-Frank to enforce many of the same laws and regulations as the agency. During the last Trump administration, California actually created its own “mini-CFPB,” while states like New York have tried to act aggressively on consumer protection. Still, there are other concerns about Musk’s potential meddling with the CFPB. DOGE’s engineers may have access to the agency’s data on X’s competitors in financial services, including details of ongoing investigations. Musk might find ways to use that information to his advantage if he accesses it, said Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the progressive advocacy group Public Citizen. “It really is just an object lesson in what the problem is with having a conflicted billionaire in charge of looking at what is going on in government and making decisions,” she said.

Though this might not sound like a lot, more retirees than you might realize count on their Social Security income as their financial foundation. In each of the previous years, national pollster Gallup has surveyed retirees to determine how important Social Security income is to their financial well-being. In every poll, to of respondents noted it was necessary, in some capacity, to help cover their expenses. Although supporting and strengthening America's leading retirement program should be a priority for our elected officials, the financial health of Social Security has been deteriorating for four decades. Reforms need to be enacted to improve the program's financial health -- and that may include President Donald Trump breaking his campaign promise and proposing cuts to Social Security. President Donald Trump delivering remarks. Image source: Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead, courtesy of the National Archives. Social Security is potentially eight years away from sweeping benefit cuts Before digging into the details of what may come to pass, it's important to understand why Social Security's financial foundation is crumbling. Ever since the first Social Security check was mailed in , the Social Security Board of Trustees has issued an annual report outlining the financial health of the program. It details where every dollar in income comes from, as well as traces where those dollars end up. What's even more intriguing are the long-term (-year) forecasts provided by the Trustees concerning the solvency of Social Security's trust funds. Though the program is incapable of going bankrupt or becoming insolvent with the way it's current set up, the existing payout schedule, inclusive of cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs), may not be sustainable. Every year since , the Trustees Report has cautioned of a long-term funding obligation shortfall. In simple terms, estimated outlays (benefits and, to a lesser extent, administrative expenses to operate Social Security) would outpace collected income in the years following the release of a report. The Trustees Report pegged this long-term shortfall at a staggering trillion. The more immediate concern is the forecast depletion of the Old-Age and Survivor Insurance Trust Fund's (OASI) asset reserves by . If this excess cash built up since inception were to be exhausted, sweeping benefit cuts of up to would await retired workers and survivor beneficiaries. The culprit behind this financial maelstrom for Social Security is a confluence of ongoing demographic changes, such as rising income inequality, a historically low U.S. birth rate, and a steep decline in the legal net migration rate since . The OASI's asset reserves are pace to be exhausted by . US Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund Assets at End of Year data by YCharts. President Trump will likely propose efficiency-based Social Security cuts Lawmakers wanting to strengthen Social Security have three choices: increase income, reduce spending, or do some combination of the two. But given that any changes to Social Security would result in some group of people being worse off than they were before, it's typically an issue that lawmakers steer clear of. Presidential candidates don't have the luxury of sweeping key issues under the rug. They're expected to offer concrete ideas as to how a clearly ailing program can be improved. While on the campaign trail, then-candidate Donald Trump made clear that he wouldn't touch Social Security. By this, he meant that no changes would be made that result in sweeping benefit cuts, as some current and future retirees fear. This would mean increases to the full retirement age are off the table. However, President Trump did leave the door wide open for efficiency-based Social Security cuts. In a December interview with Meet the Press, he responded to a question from TV journalist Kristen Welker by noting, \"I said to people we're not touching Social Security, other than we make it more efficient. But the people are going to get what they're getting.\" In each of Donald Trump's first four years in the White House, his presidential budget proposals called for a variety of efficiency-based cuts to Social Security. Based on projections, these actions would have reduced outlays by a cumulative: billion from fiscal through fiscal (the fiscal year ends on Sept. ). billion from fiscal through fiscal . billion from fiscal through fiscal . billion from fiscal through fiscal . For example, President Trump's last budget proposal aimed to make the Disability Insurance Trust Fund more efficient by halving the retroactive benefits that workers with disabilities could receive from months to six months. This would have accounted for more than half of the forecast billion in -year cost-savings. Though Donald Trump won't propose sweeping Social Security benefit cuts, all signs point to him breaking his promise to \"not touch Social Security\" by proposing efficiency-based cuts. Image source: Getty Images. The hard truth: Efficiency-based reductions won't cut it While the Trump administration's efforts to cut down on government waste and make select programs more efficient are helpful in some respects, the president's budget proposals pertaining to Social Security during his first term in the White House would have hardly made a dent in the program's widening cash shortfall. The hard truth is that strengthening Social Security will require bipartisan cooperation and some tough decision-making. On social media message boards, commentors frequently call for the removal of the earnings tax cap as a means to shore up Social Security. In , all earned income (wages and salary, but not investment income) between and is subject to a payroll tax, which is the primary means of funding Social Security. Every dollar in wages and salary above this earnings tax cap is exempt from the payroll tax. Based on a study conducted by the Social Security Administration's Office of the Actuary, completely removing the payroll tax ceiling and exposing all earned income to this tax would extend the solvency of Social Security's trust funds by \"about years. While this would kick the can decades down the road, taxing all earned income, by itself, doesn't come close to resolving Social Security's long-term funding obligation shortfall. The other common proposal is to gradually increase the full retirement age from to perhaps or . Doing so would require future generations of retirees to wait longer to receive of their retired-worker benefit, or to accept a steeper permanent reduction to their monthly payout if collecting early. Regardless of which claiming age retired workers select, their lifetime income would be reduced. Although this approach would effectively lower Social Security's outlays over numerous decades, it does nothing to address the expected exhaustion of the OASI's asset reserves in . As much as Democrats want to increase income by taxing the well-to-do and Republicans want to lower long-term outlays, these unilateral solutions would miss the mark. The only way the existing payout schedule, including COLAs, has any chance of being sustained over the long run is with bipartisan cooperation.

      "content": "Wall Street's diversity dilemma deepens as JPMorgan's Dimon sounds off on 'stupid' DEI expenses David Hollerith · Senior Reporter Sat, February , at : AM EST min read In This Article: BAC GS JPM C Wall Street’s defense of its DEI initiatives suddenly got a lot more complicated. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, a longtime advocate of diversity and using bank resources to aid minority communities, told employees this past week during a town hall that he \"was never a firm believer in bias training\" and had questions about money being spent on certain DEI programs. \"I saw how we were spending money on some of this stupid shit, and it really pissed me off,\" Dimon said, according to a recording of the town hall obtained by Yahoo Finance. \"I’m just going to cancel them. I don’t like wasted money in bureaucracy.\" Bloomberg first reported on those comments. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon. Michel Euler/Pool via REUTERS · REUTERS / Reuters Dimon was not specific about what he would cancel. He also said the bank’s approach to Black, Hispanic, and LGBTQ communities would not change, and that any plans for certain DEI initiatives were unrelated to Donald Trump’s election as president. What was notable about Dimon's new comments is how outspoken he has been about his willingness to fight outside efforts to change JPMorgan’s DEI policies. \"Bring them on,\" Dimon said about activist efforts targeting DEI during an interview with CNBC last month. Some of the biggest companies on Wall Street, including JPMorgan, are increasingly targets of conservative activists seeking changes to DEI policies across corporate America. Over the past year, such pressure has contributed to DEI retreats at a number of other high-profile companies, including Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD), Lowe’s (LOW), Ford (F), Tractor Supply (TSCO), John Deere (DE), and Target (TGT). Many of these retreats were influenced by a recent US Supreme Court decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, a ruling that prompted conservative groups to ramp up their efforts to eliminate diverse hiring practices. Corporate diversity goals are also coming under intensifying scrutiny in Washington, D.C. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and another that called for US agencies to \"combat illegal private sector DEI actions.\" “My administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense,” Trump told business leaders and politicians last month during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The National Center for Public Policy Research, the National Legal and Policy Center, and the Heritage Foundation have all submitted shareholder proposals seeking changes or deeper examinations of practices at several big banks. NCPPR and NLPC submitted anti-DEI proposals to Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan, while Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) got proposals from NLPC and Heritage asking for audits of how the banks treat customers with certain political beliefs. Robby Starbuck, who built a social media following by criticizing companies for their diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, has also set JPMorgan in his sights. \"JPMorgan ... they are going to end up being a target for us,\" the conservative Latino activist told Yahoo Finance recently. A spokesman for JPMorgan said this past week that the company's outlook on DEI isn’t changing but that the company \"regularly review[s] and make appropriate adjustments to policies and programs, including in the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision in .\" The DEI \"moniker means different things to different people,\" but for JPMorgan, it is \"about doing what we’ve done for decades — trying our best to ensure that every customer and employee has a fair opportunity and that we serve communities and grow our company,” the JPMorgan spokesman said. JPMorgan’s crosstown New York rival, Goldman, revealed a DEI change of its own this past week. It dropped a pledge to avoid taking a company public if that company had an all-white male board. Goldman’s Tony Fratto, global head of corporate communications, said in a statement that “as a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy.” Goldman would not comment on whether it plans to hold firm on its other DEI policies posted on its website, which include advancing diversity along race, gender, and sexual orientation lines within hiring, employee mentorship and networks, vendor selection, and capital allocation. Goldman Sachs headquarters in Manhattan. (Spencer Grant/GHI/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) · UCG via Getty Images Goldman said that even though its IPO mandate is now gone, it still plans to offer its board diversity initiative to interested clients through its major global banking and markets division. “We continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach,” Fratto said. The conservative activist asking Goldman’s shareholders to approve an audit of the Wall Street giant’s DEI policies said the retreat doesn’t go far enough. \"Had they come to us first and said, ‘would you withdraw your proposal if we do this,’ I think we would pretty easily have said ‘yes’,\" Stefan Padfield, executive director of National Center for Public Policy Research’s (NCPPR) Free Enterprise Project, told Yahoo Finance. NCPPR has already notched one prominent Wall Street win. It was a co-plaintiff in a lawsuit that resulted in a December ruling that rejected Nasdaq’s requirement that companies on its exchange set racial and gender targets. The group, which engaged with Goldman earlier this year, is asking the bank to conduct an independent third-party “racial discrimination” audit analyzing Goldman’s “legal and reputational risks stemming from its race-based initiatives.” The IPO pledge abandoned by Goldman was among those initiatives highlighted by NCPPR. But it wants more changes. Now “if they come back to the table and ask us to withdraw the proposal, we're going to have to have additional movement because they've already committed to do this, and they did not talk to us,” Padfield added.

The AOZQI controller design is based on the company’s high performance, proprietary AOS Advanced Transient Modulator (ATM) control scheme. In addition to supporting all the basic requirements of the OVR specification, the new AOS controller offers value-added features such as RDS(on) and DCR sensing for current monitoring and current balance. These features enable AOS’ controller to support both DrMOS and Smart Power Stages (SPS) to deliver a complete AI server and graphic card power solution along with increased design flexibility. The AOZQI control scheme offers excellent current balance at all load conditions as well as during fast load transients, which is a critical requirement for power-hungry AI and graphics SoCs that demand over several thousands of amperes of peak current. It also capably handles phase doubling or tripling without the addition of a phase doubler so a single controller can support up to a -phase design. When paired with AOS’ high performance DrMOS and SPS power stages utilizing AOS’ highly efficient and robust trench MOSFET, the AOS solution offers industry leading efficiency and thermals saving several hundred watts of power during high transient current events that can last for a few s of microseconds and up to millisecond when the SoC draws peak power. In a head-to-head comparison against a leading competitor product, each of the AOS’ x DrMOS power stages were shown to dissipate W lower power loss during these peak current events. The AOZQI supports an accurate RDS(on) sensing scheme, which uses power stage low side MOSFET RDS(on) sensing, thus enabling the use of low DCR inductors to help boost system efficiency. The device’s automatic phase management (APM) and auto discontinuous mode (DCM) power saving features extend its usability to graphics cards and gaming laptops. The AOZQI offers full programmability via the PMBUS interface and is also AVS bus compliant. The device features digitally programmable voltage and current regulation loops minimizing the external components required to implement a solution. It supports electronic control system (ECS) programmability with ability to update configuration in the field, and to pre-program up to six configuration settings with a pin-strap selection. \"AOS has a long history of developing leading-edge personal computing, server and datacenter solutions. The launch of our successful AOZQI -phase controller for OVR-based designs is the culmination of several years of R&D investment in multiphase controllers. Developed in close collaboration with our customers' system architects, the AOZQI is a robust, reliable power solution for more advanced AI servers. Plus, the design flexibility afforded by the AOZQI helps lower TCO for next generation AI servers,\" said Ralph Monteiro, Sr. VP, Power IC and Discrete Product lines at AOS. Technical Highlights NVIDIA OpenVReg compliant Up to -phase single output rail or N + M ≤ phases dual output rails is configurable Supports PWMVID, PMBus and is AVSBus compliant Digital PWMVID architecture with differential remote sensing to achieve regulated VOUT accuracy User friendly GUI for compensation and configuration with minimal external RC components Supports multi-sourced industry standard DrMOS and Smart Power Stage (SPS) ECS programmability with ability to update configuration in the field Supports Auto Phase Management (APM) and Discontinuous Mode (DCM) power saving features Proprietary, high performance AOS ATM control scheme kHz to MHz programmable switching frequency Hysteretic peak current mode control can vary frequency during transient for best-in-class response Excellent dynamic phase current balance Spread-spectrum Modulation (SSM) Output Under-Voltage Protection (UVP) Output Over-Voltage Protection (OVP) Over-Current Protection (OCP) Over-Temperature Protection (OTP) Over-Current Limit (OCL) QFNx-L package Pricing and Availability The AOZQI is immediately available in production quantities with a lead time of - weeks. The unit price for AOZQI starts at in -piece quantities.
