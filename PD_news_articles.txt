BofA cuts rating on PagerDuty stock to 'underperform' on slowing growth

Investing.com -- Bank of America downgraded Pagerduty Inc (NYSE:PD) to "Underperform" from "Buy" on slowing revenue growth and rising competition in the incident management software space. The brokerage also lowered its price target to $18 from $23.
BofA noted that PagerDuty’s core incident response revenue is growing at a slower pace, with annual recurring revenue rising just 4% in 2024 and expected to remain in the mid-single digits for fiscal 2025, which is well below the 29-33% growth seen in previous years.

Competitive pressures, including Datadog’s On-Call product, could further weigh on its lower-tier small and mid-sized business customers, which account for 16% of revenue.
While PagerDuty is expanding into AI-driven operations and customer service tools, BofA cautioned that these new offerings may not be as profitable as its core business and could limit further margin expansion.
The new price target values PagerDuty at 3.2 times its estimated 2025 revenue, a discount to infrastructure software peers, with BofA seeing few near-term catalysts for upside.

International Survey: 86% of Respondents Believe Companies Are Not Focused Enough on Service Disruptions, and Too Much on Security
SAN FRANCISCO, December 11, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PagerDuty, Inc. (NYSE:PD), a global leader in digital operations management, today released a study that reveals service disruptions remain a critical concern for IT and business executives, with 88% of respondents saying they believe another major incident will occur in the next 12 months. PagerDuty surveyed 1,000 IT and business executives who were director level and above, from the U.S., U.K., Australia and Japan. The study’s findings illustrate how critical it is for companies to implement efficient processes and strategies for preventing major incidents and mitigating damages, while maintaining customer trust.
In today’s digitally connected world, IT outages can be caused by everything from cyberattacks to human error.
86% of executives surveyed now realize that they have been prioritizing security at the expense of readiness for service disruptions, causing changes within the company. The reality is that a focus on preventing service disruptions, which can often be security-related, is imperative for organizations today. Preparedness in terms of people, process and culture is key to ensuring disruptions are minimized to limit revenue and reputational harm.
83% of business and IT executives admitted that the July global IT outage caught them off guard, exposing gaps in their preparedness for service disruptions. 89% of executives in the U.K., 84% in the U.S,, 80% in Japan and 77% in Australia admit to being surprised by the disruptions.
Nearly half of IT executives (47%) believe that insufficient incident management planning will exacerbate the impact of major IT outages on their organizations, a concern shared by 41% of business executives, if approaches to service disruption are not prioritized.
"The PagerDuty study shows that executives around the globe are shifting their leadership priorities with major incidents in mind, with 100% of those surveyed reporting a heightened focus on preparing for future service disruptions at their companies," said Eric Johnson, chief information officer at PagerDuty. "CEOs and their boards are now focused on this issue, and with the accelerated pace of AI and other advanced technologies being deployed, companies cannot afford to delay critical technology infrastructure updates."
Additionally, 55% of executives surveyed have observed a mindset shift towards continually evaluating and improving preparedness instead of a one-time move into investments in new systems or protocols that are now complete (45%).
Other key findings from the survey data include:
A strong majority of executives surveyed in the U.K. (91%), U.S. (89%), Australia (88%) and Japan (78%) believe that it’s not a matter of "if" but "when" these service disruptions happen.
While some organizations were prepared for the digital disruption, others were not. Of those that were not fully prepared, 37% of executives said the July global IT outage resulted in lost revenue or an inability to process sales transactions and delayed response times by 39% to customer or internal requests.
Organizations that experienced multiple service outages due to the July global IT disruption suffered communication breakdowns between departments (38%), delays in workflow and projects put on hold (35%). Overall, 39% of executives saw an impact on decision-making.
Nearly half in the U.S. (48%), Australia (48%), and the U.K. (47%), along with a majority in Japan (53%) believe that limited access to real-time data tools will further hinder their organizations during an outage, if approaches to service disruption are not prioritized.
For many who experienced disruptions during service incidents, the July global IT outage meant a return to the old ways of doing things, as 44% saw increased reliance on manual processes or workarounds following the incident, showing just how much organizations rely on digital tools.
The survey was conducted by Wakefield Research on behalf of PagerDuty. All survey findings and methodology are available here.

How PagerDuty’s CFO built a strong financial foundation

In the SaaS business, growing revenue tenfold, expanding product offerings, increasing headcount internationally while maintaining efficiency, launching an IPO and implementing AI — all in under a decade — makes for a significant challenge. However, PagerDuty, led by CFO Howard Wilson, has done just that.
Wilson recently completed his eighth year with the cloud-based incident management and digital operations platform. He originally joined PagerDuty as chief commercial officer in early 2017 and transitioned to CFO in September 2018. Just seven months later, in April 2019, he helped take the company public. The IPO process dominated much of Wilson’s early tenure as CFO, but he also was aware of the importance of improving the foundation around the finance function and acted accordingly.
Despite an increasingly crowded SaaS market, particularly in areas where PagerDuty operates, the company remains highly competitive. In its most recent earnings report, PagerDuty demonstrated revenue growth and achieved non-GAAP profitability despite reporting a GAAP net loss.
For Wilson, his front-row seat to the company’s evolution provides valuable lessons for CFOs navigating high-growth, high-competition environments — especially those facing the challenges of scaling efficiently while managing financial performance.

This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.
ADAM ZAKI: As the organization has grown under your leadership, particularly post-IPO, how have you ensured the finance team has been able to keep up with the increased workload?
HOWARD WILSON: When I joined the company, we weren’t even at $50 million in annual recurring revenue and now we are approaching $500 million. As a team, we’ve seen considerable revenue growth over the years. We’ve had to grow headcount significantly, not just in finance but across the organization. When I joined as chief commercial officer in 2017, before becoming CFO, we had about 170 employees. Now, we have around 1,200.
Finance started with around five people, but now if you take into account corporate strategy, investor relations and business operations we are approaching 100 people in the finance function. So we’ve grown finance’s headcount, but with efficiency in mind. When I first became CFO, it took us almost a month to close the books. Once the month ended, we’d spend the next 20-something days trying to close the books again, only for the month to be over. This is typical for a lot of startups early on but is a level of maturity that would not work in the public markets.

An Intrinsic Calculation For PagerDuty, Inc. (NYSE:PD) Suggests It's 26% Undervalued

Key Insights
Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, PagerDuty fair value estimate is US$24.92
Current share price of US$18.43 suggests PagerDuty is potentially 26% undervalued
Analyst price target for PD is US$22.27 which is 11% below our fair value estimate
Does the December share price for PagerDuty, Inc. (NYSE:PD) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.
See our latest analysis for PagerDuty
What's The Estimated Valuation?
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:

Q3 Earnings Outperformers: F5 (NASDAQ:FFIV) And The Rest Of The Software Development Stocks
Earnings results often indicate what direction a company will take in the months ahead. With Q3 behind us, let’s have a look at F5 (NASDAQ:FFIV) and its peers.
As legendary VC investor Marc Andreessen says, "Software is eating the world", and it touches virtually every industry. That drives increasing demand for tools helping software developers do their jobs, whether it be monitoring critical cloud infrastructure, integrating audio and video functionality, or ensuring smooth content streaming.
The 11 software development stocks we track reported a strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 3.3% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 0.7% above.
In light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady as they are up 4.4% on average since the latest earnings results.
F5 (NASDAQ:FFIV)
Initially started as a hardware appliances company in the late 1990s, F5 (NASDAQ:FFIV) makes software that helps large enterprises ensure their web applications are always available by distributing network traffic and protecting them from cyberattacks.
F5 reported revenues of $746.7 million, up 5.6% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 2.2%. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ billings estimates and revenue guidance for next quarter slightly topping analysts’ expectations.
“Our fourth quarter revenue of $747 million reflects 6% growth year over year and includes a 19% increase in software revenue from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023,” said François Locoh-Donou, F5’s President and CEO.
F5 Total Revenue
Interestingly, the stock is up 15.6% since reporting and currently trades at $252.44.

Best Q3: JFrog (NASDAQ:FROG)
Named after the founders' affinity for frogs, JFrog (NASDAQ:FROG) provides a software-as-a-service platform that makes developing and releasing software easier and faster, especially for large teams.
JFrog reported revenues of $109.1 million, up 23% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 3.3%. The business had a very strong quarter with an impressive beat of analysts’ billings estimates and accelerating growth in large customers.
JFrog Total Revenue
Although it had a fine quarter compared to its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 6.6% since reporting. It currently trades at $30.70.

Weakest Q3: Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM)
Founded in 1999 by two engineers from MIT, Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) provides software for organizations to efficiently deliver web content to their customers.
Akamai reported revenues of $1.00 billion, up 4.1% year on year, exceeding analysts’ expectations by 0.5%. Still, it was a slower quarter as it posted revenue guidance for the next quarter below analysts’ expectations.
Akamai delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates, slowest revenue growth, and weakest full-year guidance update in the group. As expected, the stock is down 8.6% since the results and currently trades at $95.42.
Read our full analysis of Akamai’s results here.
PagerDuty (NYSE:PD)
Started by three former Amazon engineers, PagerDuty (NYSE:PD) is a software-as-a-service platform that helps companies respond to IT incidents fast and make sure that any downtime is minimized.
PagerDuty reported revenues of $118.9 million, up 9.4% year on year. This print beat analysts’ expectations by 2.2%. Aside from that, it was a satisfactory quarter as it also recorded accelerating customer growth but a miss of analysts’ billings estimates.
The company added 6 customers to reach a total of 15,050. The stock is down 14.1% since reporting and currently trades at $18.

HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP)
Initially created as a research project at the University of Washington, HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP) provides software that helps companies operate their own applications in a multi-cloud environment.
HashiCorp reported revenues of $173.4 million, up 18.7% year on year. This number surpassed analysts’ expectations by 6.1%. It was a strong quarter as it also logged a solid beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates and billings in line with analysts’ estimates.
The company added 12 enterprise customers paying more than $100,000 annually to reach a total of 946. The stock is up 1.1% since reporting and currently trades at $34.

Market Update
Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.

Cathie Wood Goes Bargain Hunting: 3 Stocks She Just Bought
Rick Munarriz, The Motley Fool
Fri, February 7, 2025 at 7:45 PM GMT+5 5 min read
In This Article:
RBLX
-1.25%
AMZN
-4.05%
PD
+0.11%
Ark Invest co-founder and CEO Cathie Wood is one of the best-known growth investors in the realm of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). She also happens to be one of the most aggressive, loading up Ark Invest with high-flying and disruptive investments.
Ark publishes its transactions at the end of every trading day. Wood added to her existing stakes in Roblox (NYSE: RBLX), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and PagerDuty (NYSE: PD) on Thursday. Let's take a closer look.
1. Roblox
If Wood believes in a company, she has no problem taking advantage of a sell-off. Shares of Roblox plummeted 11% on Thursday after the company posted a poorly received financial update. It got Wood's attention. She bought additional shares of the online gaming platform developer in three of her ETFs.
It was a "beat and graze" performance. Roblox delivered a beat on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 32% to $988 million in the fourth quarter, accelerating from its pace through the first nine months of the year and topping its earlier guidance of $930 million to $950 million. Roblox also came through with a smaller deficit than expected.
Image source: Getty Images.
Here comes the "graze" part. Bookings -- a critical metric for Roblox and its gaming peers -- rose a weaker-than-expected 21% to reach $1.36 billion. Unlike its revenue showing, bookings growth actually decelerated in the final quarter of 2024. This isn't the only problem. Average daily active users rose 19% to 85.3 million, and that's good. Bookings per daily active user rose just 1%, and that's bad.
Bulls will argue that double-digit expansion for revenue, bookings, and player base are encouraging for the popularity of Roblox. The $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion in bookings that Roblox is modeling for the new year translates into 19% to 21%, in line with its current run rate. The bears can counter that Roblox needs to do better. Even after Thursday's dip, the shares have still more than doubled since last year's springtime low. The red ink will continue, as the annual loss should top $1 billion at the midpoint of this week's guidance. However, Roblox should exceed $800 million in free cash flow. Betting against a gaming platform that is growing its audience and proving its stickiness could prove dangerous to the naysayers.
2. Amazon
Wood doesn't just respond to fresh financials. Ark Invest purchased shares of Amazon on Thursday, just before the online retailing giant posted its fourth-quarter results after the market close. With analyst profit targets inching higher and new tariffs making it easier to compete against Chinese deep discounters, adding to her current position seemed like a good idea in theory. Reality had another plan.
Shares of Amazon moved initially lower after the company announced results for its seasonally potent holiday quarter. Like Roblox, the headline numbers were strong. Net sales rose 10% to $187.8 billion, just ahead of Wall Street pro forecasts. It would've been an 11% top-line jump if it weren't for the rising dollar gnawing away at the value of international sales. Its cloud-hosting Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform continues to be the growth leader, clocking in with a 19% year-over-year rise.
Its profitability grew even faster, and net income of $1.86 a share is well ahead of the $1.46 a share the market was expecting. Amazon scored double-digit-percentage beats on the bottom line through 2024, including back-to-back quarters of 25% positive surprises to close out the year.
Amazon's stumbling block was its uninspiring guidance. The e-commerce giant is projecting 5% to 9% growth in net sales for the current quarter. It's bracing for gustier headwinds on the currency front, but even adjusting for that 150-basis-point hit, the midpoint of its outlook still translates into revenue growth decelerating to the high single digits. The midpoint of its operating income forecast is just a 5% rise. After three consecutive years of sub 12% net sales growth, 2025 is off to a rough start.
3. PagerDuty
Wood was aggressively buying shares of PagerDuty until the summer of last year. She even bought shares every trading day in June. Her final purchase came in late September, but she was a buyer again on Thursday.
Unlike Roblox and Amazon with stocks that have soared 65% and 41% respectively over the past year, PagerDuty has been a laggard. Shares of the cloud-based provider of enterprise analytics and uptime monitoring solutions have fallen 20% over the past year. Revenue growth has been slowing over the past two years, but let's check the tape of top-line jumps.
Q2 2023: 34%
Q3 2023: 31%
Q4 2023: 29%
Q1 2024: 21%
Q2 2024: 19%
Q3 2024: 15%
Q4 2024: 10%
Q1 2025: 8%
Q2 2025: 8%
Q3 2025: 9%
After seven consecutive quarters of decelerating gains, revenue accelerated in PagerDuty's fiscal third quarter that ended in October. Its dollar-based net retention rate is also starting to rise again after a steady slide. If it can get back to double-digit revenue growth when it reports in a few weeks -- or at some point in fiscal 2026 -- PagerDuty has a good chance of bouncing back. Wood was too early when she was on her PagerDuty shopping spree last year, but her timing seems to be better now.

NCNO Stock Price Increases 9% in 6 Months: Should You Buy It Now?

NCNO
-0.03%
PD
+0.11%
nCino NCNO shares have returned 8.9% over the past six months, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s rise of 5.4% and the Zacks Internet - Software industry’s return of 13.3%.

The underperformance can be attributed to intense competition in the fintech industry, particularly from companies offering similar cloud-based solutions to financial institutions. Potential integration challenges from recent acquisitions have further contributed to NCNO's struggles.

However, the company reported strong third-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues and year-over-year subscription revenue growth on Dec. 4. Improved operating margins and business expansions highlight its robust growth potential.

These factors have enabled NCNO to outperform its peers, including AudioEye AEYE, Inseego INSG and PagerDuty PD, over the same period.

In the fiscal third quarter, nCino secured more than 30 multi-solution deals and generated a higher volume of gross bookings from new customers than in the previous two quarters combined.

The company secured major deals, including an expansion with a top-40 U.S. bank for commercial and small business lending, and signed its largest customer in Japan — Tokushima Taisho Bank, highlighting strong demand for its solutions across diverse markets.

nCino completed the acquisition of FullCircl in November 2024. This acquisition is expected to enhance NCNO's product offerings and expand its market presence in the EMEA region.

The company completed the acquisition of Integrated Lending Technologies in April 2024, strengthening its capabilities in the lending technology space.

In March 2024, the company acquired DocFox, a solution provider for automating onboarding experiences in commercial and business banking.

PagerDuty Declines 16% YTD: Should You Buy the Stock on the Dip?
Zacks Equity Research
December 18, 2024 4 min read
In This Article:
PD
+0.11%
PagerDuty PD shares have plunged 15.7% in the year-to-date period against the Zacks  Internet - Software industry’s rise of 38.3% and the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 35.5%. 

PD has underperformed its peers, such as Atlassian TEAM, which offers similar digital operations management solutions. TEAM shares gained 13.5% over the same time frame.

The underperformance can be attributed to ongoing weakness in the Small and Medium-sized Business segment and a challenging macroeconomic environment impacting the Enterprise segment, leading to longer sales cycles.

Despite these challenges, PD is benefiting from an expanding customer base and increased adoption of its Operations Cloud, including AIOps and automation capabilities.
PagerDuty Price and Consensus
PagerDuty Price and Consensus
PagerDuty price-consensus-chart | PagerDuty Quote
PD has seen a rise in high-value customers, with the number spending more than $100,000 in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and increasing to 825 in the third quarter of 2024, a 6% rise compared with the last year. This highlights the growing adoption and expansion of PagerDuty’s solutions among large-scale customers.
PagerDuty Sees Growth With AI-Driven Automation Solutions
Growing demand for automation and generative AI has been a major growth driver for Pager Duty. 

In response to this demand in the third quarter of 2024, PD introduced AI-driven solutions, such as PagerDuty Advance, which integrates generative AI to improve incident management and reduce response times. This innovation has attracted more customers seeking to automate and optimize its IT operations.

Increased demand for automated and intelligent incident management solutions has been noteworthy. In October, PagerDuty announced innovations for its Operations Cloud, enhancing AI-driven automation and machine learning to help organizations improve operational resilience, reduce downtime and mitigate the risk of outages.

The company’s AIOps and Automation capabilities have been key contributors, accounting for more than 40% of its net new ARR in the third quarter of 2024, demonstrating the increasing demand for these advanced tools in IT operations and incident management.
PD Benefits From Expanding Clientele
PagerDuty’s growing portfolio has been helping it expand its clientele, bolstered by partnerships with key industry players including Amazon AMZN and Snowflake SNOW.

PagerDuty recently announced new generative AI and automation features for PagerDuty Advance, integrated with Amazon’s cloud computing platform Amazon Web Service (AWS) tools like Amazon Bedrock, Bedrock Guardrails, and Amazon Q Business, to enhance incident management and operational efficiency.

PagerDuty has integrated its Operations Cloud with Snowflake Trail to help joint customers proactively manage incidents, improve operational efficiency, and reduce downtime using observability and incident management capabilities.
PD Initiates Strong FY24 Guidance
For the fourth quarter of 2024, PagerDuty expects revenues between $118.5 million and $120.5 million. Non-GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to be in the range of 15-16 cents per share. 

For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $119.46 million indicating a year-over-year increase of 7.50%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2024 earnings is pegged at 16 cents per share, which has remained unchanged in the past 30 days.

For fiscal 2024, the company expects revenues in the range of $464.5 million-$466.5 million (compared with the previous guidance of $463.0 million-$467.0 million), representing a growth rate of 8% year over year.

Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of 78-79 cents per share (up from the previous guidance of 67-72 cents per share).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $465.54 million, indicating a year-over-year increase of 8.09%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at 78 cents per share, which has increased 11% in the past 30 days.

What Should Investors Do With PD Stock?
We point out that PagerDuty stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.

In terms of Price/Book ratio, PD is trading at 15.83X, higher than the Zacks Internet - Software industry’s 3.78X.

However, PD’s robust AI portfolio and an expanding partner base are key drivers that make the stock attractive for investors.

PagerDuty stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a Growth Score of A, a favorable combination that offers a strong investment opportunity, per the Zacks Proprietary methodology. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

New AI capabilities empower operations management teams to harness generative AI and automation for faster innovation, increased uptime and better customer experiences
LAS VEGAS, December 03, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AWS re:Invent 2024-- PagerDuty, Inc. (NYSE:PD), a global leader in digital operations management, today announced new generative AI (genAI) and automation features of PagerDuty Advance, which is embedded across the PagerDuty Operations Cloud platform, in collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Unveiled onstage at AWS re:Invent 2024 by PagerDuty Chairperson and CEO, Jennifer Tejada, during AWS CEO Matt Garman’s keynote, the latest collaboration combines the capabilities of PagerDuty Advance with Amazon Q Business, Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, empowering organizations to safely deploy genAI into their incident management processes while becoming more automated, connected and operationally resilient.
PagerDuty research has shown that major service and operational disruptions have increased by 43% during the past year, with costs rising to $800,000 per incident. Modern technology infrastructures and services have grown more complex and interdependent, especially when navigating tech debt. Whether a bank, media streaming service or a retailer, organizations across all industries need a reliable way to respond, recover, and learn from incidents to move toward prevention and build automation across the organization.
"AWS and PagerDuty share a commitment to operational excellence, and together we help organizations around the world reliably serve millions of enterprise customers at scale, with speed and resilience," said Matt Garman, CEO of AWS. "We’re expanding our longstanding partnership to help businesses safely apply generative AI to make operations more automated, responsive, and efficient. This new collaboration helps our customers proactively prevent and resolve issues to maintain the highest reliability standards for their digital operations."
"Today’s customers demand flawless digital experiences, making reliable technology essential for achieving ‘always-on’ operational resilience," said Jennifer Tejada, Chairperson and CEO, PagerDuty. "PagerDuty and AWS are strengthening our 11-year partnership, which already supports nearly 6,000 joint customers, to further integrate generative AI into digital operations management. Together, we are driving transformative outcomes — helping organizations grow revenue, accelerate innovation, and reduce risk with confidence."
Through the power of AI and automation, the PagerDuty Operations Cloud detects and diagnoses disruptive events, mobilizes the right team members to respond, and streamlines infrastructure and workflows across digital operations. The launch of these new AI and automation tools will help joint customers of AWS and PagerDuty enhance their operational efficiency and redefine what it means to respond to incidents faster and smarter.
Latest GenAI Collaboration Between AWS and PagerDuty
PagerDuty Advance integration with Amazon Bedrock: PagerDuty Advance assistant for Slack and Microsoft Teams delivers AI-powered incident context support through chat. These capabilities are powered by Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service on AWS offering customers a broad set of capabilities to easily build, deploy and scale generative AI applications. Already, more than 330 organizations use PagerDuty Advance, which is embedded across the PagerDuty Operations Cloud platform, to improve situational awareness and accelerate triage during an incident. Using PagerDuty Advance with Bedrock, incident responders can more easily get answers to questions, such as "Are there any other affected services?", "Has this incident occurred in the past?" or "What’s the next best step toward resolution?" — without having to ask others these questions. It is estimated that organizations could save hundreds of thousands per incident, factoring in the cost impact of incidents and staffing costs.1
PagerDuty Advance integration with Amazon Bedrock Guardrails: While genAI and automation can help save time and create significant efficiencies, implementing safeguards can be critical to safer and more accurate query responses. The integration of PagerDuty Advance with Amazon Bedrock Guardrails helps to improve relevance and factual accuracy in genAI responses, which is essential to effective incident management. Additionally, the integration offers certain protections against hallucinations and helps block undesired topics and harmful content, such as malicious text inputs from generating responses.
PagerDuty Advance plugin integration with Amazon Q Business: PagerDuty is the first incident management platform to integrate with Amazon Q Business, one of the most capable genAI-powered assistants for leveraging companies’ internal data. PagerDuty Advance customers can now utilize a single user interface via Amazon Q Business plugins to query on data from multiple applications, including PagerDuty Advance. Using the new Amazon Q plugin, this centralized source of truth reduces the need to shuffle between third-party applications to retrieve critical incident data. In interviews with PagerDuty Advance early access adopters, customers indicated that they saved on average 30 minutes per incident. This could mean hundreds of thousands of dollars saved per incident, factoring in the cost impact of incidents and staffing costs.

"AI continues to be a top priority for IT leaders as they look to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and drive faster decision-making. Generative AI is reshaping how organizations approach incident management and operational resilience. As digital infrastructures grow more complex, IT leaders are leveraging AI to not only respond to disruptions but also predict and prevent them. Partnerships like the one between AWS and PagerDuty provide a clear roadmap for how enterprises can strategically implement AI to achieve their goals of agility, reliability, and superior customer experiences," said Stephen Elliot, Group Vice President and Analyst, IDC.

PagerDuty (PD) Upgraded to Strong Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?
Zacks Equity Research
January 13, 2025 3 min read
In This Article:
PD
+0.11%
Investors might want to bet on PagerDuty (PD), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.
Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for PagerDuty basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.
For PagerDuty, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.
The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.
Earnings Estimate Revisions for PagerDuty
For the fiscal year ending January 2025, this software developer is expected to earn $0.79 per share, which is a change of 6.8% from the year-ago reported number.
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for PagerDuty. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 26%.
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>
The upgrade of PagerDuty to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

The 2025 PagerDuty State of Digital Operations Report (Graphic: Business Wire)
Data reveals a more pragmatic approach to AI adoption, prioritizing ROI on investments
SAN FRANCISCO, January 22, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PagerDuty, Inc. (NYSE:PD), a global leader in digital operations management, today published the 2025 State of Digital Operations Report, which demonstrates the excitement for the business impact that AI and automation have delivered. Based on survey responses from more than 1,100 operations leaders across the North American, European, Middle Eastern, and African (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) regions, the data highlights how efficiency, security and innovation are among the top priorities shaping IT operations in 2025.
The fourth edition of the State of Digital Operations Report showcases the continued maturation of digital operations over the past year, with respondents citing significant improvements in operational resilience, more effective use of automation and faster time to market. The improvements respondents reported are driving optimism about IT spending in 2025, with a majority of leaders expecting their budgets to increase year-over-year.
State of Digital Operations Survey Results
64% of respondents expect IT operations budgets to increase in 2025 to support continued investments in operational efficiency, resilience and excellence.
Enthusiasm for agentic AI is highest among CIOs and CTOs, with a majority (53%) viewing it as core to future IT operations.
Although automation has become more sophisticated and pervasive across all industries and regions, leaders cite two challenges as the top barriers to broader adoption: mitigating security risks and navigating a talent gap to ensure teams have the right skills and capabilities to drive and support automation across the organization.
"PagerDuty’s 2025 State of Digital Operations Report shows that AI has rapidly grown to become the backbone of digital operations, helping reduce toil, improve resilience and drive tremendous efficiency," said Katherine Calvert, chief marketing officer at PagerDuty. "With PagerDuty, organizations can more easily integrate AI and automation into their operations to grow revenue and drive efficiency while building resilience and reducing risk."
In 2024, AI has evolved from a novelty technology to the cornerstone of modern IT operations. Survey respondents reported that they were experiencing the benefits of GenAI across many key performance indicators including:
Operational efficiency gains (37%)
Improved customer experiences (36%)
Better insights from data (38%)
Agentic AI is particularly poised to play a critical role within the next one to two years, with 88% of respondents viewing agentic AI to be either core or peripheral to future IT operations.

Software Development Stocks Q3 Teardown: PagerDuty (NYSE:PD) Vs The Rest
The end of an earnings season can be a great time to discover new stocks and assess how companies are handling the current business environment. Let’s take a look at how PagerDuty (NYSE:PD) and the rest of the software development stocks fared in Q3.
As legendary VC investor Marc Andreessen says, "Software is eating the world", and it touches virtually every industry. That drives increasing demand for tools helping software developers do their jobs, whether it be monitoring critical cloud infrastructure, integrating audio and video functionality, or ensuring smooth content streaming.
The 11 software development stocks we track reported a strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 3.3% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 0.7% above.
In light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady as they are up 3.8% on average since the latest earnings results.
PagerDuty (NYSE:PD)
Started by three former Amazon engineers, PagerDuty (NYSE:PD) is a software-as-a-service platform that helps companies respond to IT incidents fast and make sure that any downtime is minimized.
PagerDuty reported revenues of $118.9 million, up 9.4% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 2.2%. Overall, it was a satisfactory quarter for the company with accelerating customer growth but a miss of analysts’ billings estimates.
“PagerDuty delivered a solid quarter with revenue and non-GAAP operating income results well above third quarter guidance ranges with annual recurring revenue increasing to $483 million, growing 10% year-over-year,” said Chairperson and CEO, Jennifer Tejada.
PagerDuty Total Revenue
Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 12.8% since reporting and currently trades at $18.26.

Best Q3: JFrog (NASDAQ:FROG)
Named after the founders' affinity for frogs, JFrog (NASDAQ:FROG) provides a software-as-a-service platform that makes developing and releasing software easier and faster, especially for large teams.
JFrog reported revenues of $109.1 million, up 23% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 3.3%. The business had a very strong quarter with an impressive beat of analysts’ billings estimates and accelerating growth in large customers.
JFrog Total Revenue
Although it had a fine quarter compared to its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 11.3% since reporting. It currently trades at $29.16.

Weakest Q3: Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM)
Founded in 1999 by two engineers from MIT, Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) provides software for organizations to efficiently deliver web content to their customers.
Akamai reported revenues of $1.00 billion, up 4.1% year on year, exceeding analysts’ expectations by 0.5%. It was a slower quarter: Akamai beat analysts’ EBITDA expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its revenue guidance for next quarter missed analysts’ expectations and its full-year revenue guidance slightly missed Wall Street’s estimates.
Akamai delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates, slowest revenue growth, and weakest full-year guidance update in the group. As expected, the stock is down 8.3% since the results and currently trades at $95.72.
Read our full analysis of Akamai’s results here.
Bandwidth (NASDAQ:BAND)
Started in 1999 by David Morken who was later joined by Henry Kaestner as co-founder in 2001, Bandwidth (NASDAQ:BAND) provides thousands of customers with a software platform that uses its own global network to provide phone numbers, voice, and text connectivity.
Bandwidth reported revenues of $193.9 million, up 27.5% year on year. This print surpassed analysts’ expectations by 6.5%. It was a very strong quarter as it also put up a solid beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates and revenue guidance for next quarter exceeding analysts’ expectations.
Bandwidth pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat and highest full-year guidance raise among its peers. The stock is down 9.6% since reporting and currently trades at $17.03.

Founded in 2008 by Jeff Lawson, a former engineer at Amazon, Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) is a software as a service platform that makes it really easy for software developers to use text messaging, voice calls and other forms of communication in their apps.
Twilio reported revenues of $1.13 billion, up 9.7% year on year. This result topped analysts’ expectations by 3.7%. Overall, it was a very strong quarter as it also produced EPS guidance for next quarter exceeding analysts’ expectations and a solid beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates.

Market Update
Thanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.

Morgan Stanley raised the firm’s price target on PagerDuty (PD) to $20 from $19 and keeps an Equal Weight rating on the shares. ARR growth sustained at 10% for a fourth quarter in a row as revenue growth slightly improved in Q3, but slipped deals pushed back the time frame for ARR acceleration to FY26, the analyst noted post-earnings. Signs of stabilization across the business are “encouraging,” but the firm stays Equal Weight until more material inflection in growth emerges, the analyst added.

JP Morgan downgrades PagerDuty and C3.ai on market dynamics

Investing.com -- JPMorgan downgraded both Pagerduty Inc (NYSE:PD) and C3.ai Inc (NYSE:AI) from “neutral” to “underweight” citing competitive pressures, market dynamics, and valuation concerns.
PagerDuty’s rating was cut from due to what JPMorgan described as "crosscurrents" in the company’s multi-product platform strategy. Brokerage noted increasing competition in PagerDuty’s core market, with large players in observability and IT service management expanding into automation and artificial intelligence-driven operations.
These shifts could create challenges for PagerDuty, particularly in securing favorable contract terms and growing its customer base. While the company’s existing customers are likely to remain loyal, JPMorgan expressed doubts about PagerDuty’s ability to achieve significant growth in the near term.
JPMorgan downgraded AI firm C3.ai pointing to its financial performance, uneven growth and slim margins. While C3.ai has recently improved its revenue growth, JPMorgan pointed out the high costs associated with achieving those gains.
Additionally, a key strategic partnership with Baker Hughes (NASDAQ:BKR) may expire in April 2025, posing a potential risk.
Although an expanded partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) could help boost growth, JPMorgan said it would need to see more evidence of success before revising its outlook.
While brokerage raised its price target for Confluent, which specializes in data streaming technology, by $3 to $38 on strong growth prospects.
