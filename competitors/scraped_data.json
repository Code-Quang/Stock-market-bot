        "Extracted Text": "Pony AI Inc. (simplified Chinese: \u5c0f\u9a6c\u667a\u884c; traditional Chinese: \u5c0f\u99ac\u667a\u884c; pinyin: Xi\u01ceom\u01ce Zh\u00ecx\u00edng) is a autonomous vehicle technology company co-located in Silicon Valley, Beijing, and Guangzhou.[3] The company was founded in December 2016 by James Peng and Tiancheng Lou, formerly software developers for Baidu in Silicon Valley.[4][5] The company has partnered with equipment manufacturers such as Toyota. Pony.ai has permits to run fully driverless ride-hailing services in Beijing and Guangzhou, China.[6] In April 2019, Pony.ai launched a pilot system covering 50 km2 (19 sq mi) in Guangzhou for employees and invited affiliates, serving pre-defined pick-up points.[7] In November 2019, the company started a three-month trial in Irvine, California, with 10 cars and defined stops for pick-up and drop-off.[8] In May 2021, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) permitted Pony.ai to test six autonomous vehicles without human safety drivers on specified streets in Fremont, Milpitas and Irvine. The permit restricts operation to roads with speed limits not exceeding 45 miles per hour (72 km/h) in clear weather and light precipitation. Testing was planned to start in Fremont and Milpitas on weekdays between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.[9] In June 2021, testing began in Fremont and Milpitas.[10] On October 28, a Pony.ai vehicle operating in autonomous mode hit a road center divider and a traffic sign in Fremont after turning right. In December 2021, California DMV suspended a driverless testing permit for Pony.ai following this accident. It is the first time for DMV to issue such a suspension.[11] Subsequently, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a probe.[12] More than four months after the accident, the NHTSA announced the \"first recall of an automated driving system\" as the company complied with the government agency\u2019s request.[13] In May 2022, California DMV revoked Pony.ai's permit for failing to monitor the driving records of the safety drivers on its testing permit.[14] As of June 2023, Pony.ai is back to testing its fleet with safety drivers present in California.[6] According to the California DMV, in 2021 Pony.ai had the third-highest number of miles driven, behind Waymo and Cruise.[15] In April 2022, Pony.ai became the first autonomous driving company to get a taxi license in China.[16] In July 2022, Pony.ai partnered with equipment manufacturer Sany Heavy Industry to mass produce autonomous driving trucks in China.[17] In April 2023, Pony.ai was licensed to operate robotaxi services in Guangzhou.[18] In August 2023, Toyota and Pony.ai developed plans to mass produce robotaxis in China. The two companies and GAC-Toyota, a venture between the Japanese automaker and Chinese state-owned Guangzhou Automobile Group, will invest more than 1 billion yuan ($140 million) combined.[19] In January 2018, Pony.ai completed a $112 million Series A round co-led by Morningside Venture Capital and Legend Capital with seed round lead-investor Sequoia China and investor IDG Capital also participating in the round, alongside Hongtai Capital, Legend Star, Puhua Capital, Polaris Capital, DCM Ventures, Comcast Ventures and Silicon Valley Future Capital.[20] In February 2020, Toyota invested $400 million in the company as part of a funding round of $462 million.[21] Toyota previously announced that it was working with Pony.ai to test self-driving cars on public roads in Beijing and Shanghai.[22] As of 2020, the company had a valuation of $5.3 billion.[23] The company intended to go public on the New York Stock Exchange via an SPAC route. However, in 2021, the company suspended its plans due to Chinese regulators.[24] In October 2023, Pony.ai received $100 million from Neom, Saudi Arabia, to develop, manufacture and deploy autonomous vehicles and smart infrastructure in Neom and the MENA region. The agreement includes the establishment of a regional R&D and manufacturing headquarters.[25] In November 2024, Pony.ai held its initial public offering (IPO) and became a listed company on the Nasdaq raising $260 million. This is one of the largest IPOs in the United States stock market involving autonomous driving sector.[26] Shares 15% opened above their offer price in their market debut.[27]",

        "Extracted Text": "Written by 36Kr English Published on 4 Dec 2024 14 mins read After eight years, Pony.ai, once the most highly valued autonomous driving company in China, finally went public. Pony.ai\u2019s entrepreneurial story began in late 2016, a prime year for autonomous driving. Flush with cash, internet giants entered the fray with confidence. Uber acquired the self-driving truck company Otto for USD 700 million, while Google\u2019s autonomous driving project Waymo became an independent entity. Traditional automakers, eager for transformation, also jumped in with their self-driving plans. Meanwhile, chipmakers like Intel partnered with BMW and Mobileye to enter the space. At Baidu\u2019s autonomous driving division, James Peng and Lou Tiancheng decided over a cup of coffee to leave their stable positions at a major corporation to establish Pony.ai. During the years when the mobile internet boom had peaked, autonomous driving became an industry receiving the most investor attention. Naturally, the combination of these two renowned technologists attracted top-tier institutional investors, and Pony.ai\u2019s valuation soared, solidifying its position as a leader in the autonomous driving field. In many ways, Pony.ai\u2019s fundraising history is like a smaller version of Nio\u2019s story. From being surrounded by top-tier USD venture capital funds, to embracing industrial funds from traditional automakers, and finally attracting sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East, Pony.ai was fortunate enough to survive the different stages of investors\u2019 honeymoon with autonomous driving. In June 2021, with the help of financial investors, Pony.ai began its IPO process. It was supposed to go public at a time when both capital and confidence were at their peak. However, as the climate for Chinese companies listing in the US worsened, Pony.ai\u2019s IPO had to be suspended. Today, autonomous driving is no longer considered an appealing investment. Massive losses are detailed in Pony.ai\u2019s prospectus, and its market capitalization has been halved compared to its last funding round. For the later-stage sovereign or industrial funds that bet on Pony.ai, as well as the early financial investors who once anticipated a USD 10 billion IPO three years ago, the current low-hanging fruit is clearly less satisfying than they hoped. This, perhaps, is the stark reality that technology investors must face: If a company does not seize the moment when the technological winds are in its favor, the bright young talents in the commercial world will not be widely embraced by the broader market. Through interviews with nearly ten Pony.ai investors and the company\u2019s founder, Peng, 36Kr attempts to explore the question: When a new technology company faces valuation declines and real commercialization challenges, when is the best time for venture capital to invest? In June 2021, Pony.ai was just one step away from its IPO. Four months earlier, the Chinese autonomous driving company completed a USD 250 million Series C+ funding round at a valuation exceeding USD 5 billion. Investors included the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan (OTPP) through its Teachers\u2019 Venture Growth (TVG) program (formerly Teachers\u2019 Innovation Platform), the Brunei Investment Agency, and CPE. Sources familiar with the financing revealed that this occurred when Tesla shares were surging in the secondary market and Waymo\u2019s fundraising was smooth. Large foreign pension or sovereign funds\u2014many of which serve as limited partners for Chinese general partners\u2014were opening offices in mainland China or Hong Kong. Across the ocean, the highly valued Pony.ai naturally caught their attention. By then, Pony.ai had accelerated its expansion. In December 2020, Pony.ai established a trucking division and registered PonyTron, which at its peak had a team of around 100. By June 2021, it had set up a vehicle development team of over ten people in Shanghai\u2019s Jiading district, marking its entry into vehicle manufacturing. All actions pointed toward going public. An investor said that an IPO was seriously being considered at that time, with rumors at one point alluding to a valuation that exceeds USD 10 billion, or even USD 12 billion. But a black swan event changed everything. In August 2021, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) called for a halt on IPOs for Chinese companies. After more than a year of preparation, Pony.ai\u2019s listing was canceled due to force majeure. That autumn also marked the beginning of the decline for USD funds in China. \u201cA fast-moving vehicle that suddenly encounters obstacles will inevitably face turbulence,\u201d one investor said. First, the vehicle manufacturing plans were indefinitely delayed. Several core employees from PonyTron left to start their own companies, one of which was even funded by Pony.ai\u2019s old investors. The turbulent period continued. In October, a Pony.ai test vehicle hit a road sign while changing lanes in California, leading to the first-ever recall of a Level 4 autonomous driving system. Pony.ai then considered listing in Hong Kong or mainland China. \u201cThere were said to be ongoing discussions about potential opportunities, but Pony.ai had yet to achieve profitability. Peng admitted in an interview that the team faced a significant challenge due to the industry\u2019s uncertainty\u2014large-scale commercialization was not yet visible. He raised the question of whether the company would have enough resources to sustain development if commercialization dragged on longer. An investor remarked that, while the industry remained obscure in 2017 and 2018, by 2021\u2014similar to the present situation with large language models (LLMs)\u2014the market became more transparent. Challenges in commercialization or technology could be discerned through due diligence. Combined with wavering confidence in Chinese stocks, most believed that if Pony.ai did not go public, it would struggle to raise money in the primary market at its USD 5 billion valuation. No one knew how long the winter would last. One investor recalled Pony.ai jokingly telling them about regrets of not raising more funds earlier. Apart from staff reductions, business downsizing, and a pivot to products that could generate immediate commercial returns, Pony.ai also sought alternative paths. When Level 4 autonomous driving faced hurdles in complex, low-probability scenarios, the company turned to Level 2 advanced driving assistance systems as a temporary lifeline. At one point, Pony.ai even aimed to position itself as a supplier of driving assistance technology. After the failed IPO attempt, Pony.ai allocated some resources to develop and enhance Level 2 driving assistance systems. In Guangzhou\u2019s Nansha district and Beijing\u2019s Yizhuang district, Pony.ai vehicles without light detection and ranging (LiDAR) were frequently seen on the streets, offering driving assistance. Amid these challenges, Pony.ai managed to stay afloat. Let us rewind to 2016, the dreamlike beginnings of Pony.ai. After deciding to start the company, Peng\u2019s first call was to Zhou Kui, a partner at HongShan (formerly Sequoia Capital China). Earlier that year, Zhou attended Sequoia\u2019s annual meeting in Silicon Valley, where he met Peng at Baidu\u2019s US research lab. In October, Zhou received a call from Peng, who had just returned to Beijing and was considering partnering with Lou to start a self-driving venture. Zhou quickly brought in Neil Shen and Fu Xin, also from HongShan, to meet Peng. Lou recalled a preinvestment dinner with Shen, during which he was posed numerous unrelated and seemingly random questions, none of which had to do with autonomous driving. Lou answered them one by one. Later, Shen explained that he wanted to assess Lou\u2019s overall personality through casual conversation. During its Series A financing, Pony.ai opened up 20% of its shares. HongShan led the round, investing USD 10.5 million for a 15% stake at a USD 70 million valuation. HongShan continued to invest in Pony.ai across four rounds and is now the company\u2019s largest financial investor with a 10.2% stake. Due to the relevance of Pony.ai to multiple tech and automotive sectors, three HongShan partners were involved in the investment, which is rare. \u201c2016 was still the early days for autonomous driving,\u201d Zhou told 36Kr. \u201cOur judgment at HongShan was that the field had immense potential but would require persistence and long-term investment. There are no shortcuts.\u201d He also emphasized that it was a field requiring highly talented technical founders to gather in one place to innovate. Peng was one of Baidu\u2019s earliest US researchers and served as the chief architect for Baidu\u2019s self-driving efforts. He was one of the very few engineers at Baidu to hold a T11-level title. Lou, known as one of the world\u2019s top programmers, had worked at Google\u2019s self-driving team and was Baidu\u2019s youngest T10 engineer. Early investors believed that such a founding team would naturally attract other talented technologists and lay the foundation for autonomous driving. One investor shared an anecdote: whenever Lou hosted a dinner, alumni from Tsinghua University\u2019s prestigious Yao Class would join without hesitation. According to Peng, the first round of financing did not involve massive roadshows or excessive focus on valuation. The founders only reached out to four investors, and HongShan and IDG Capital chose to support the company. During Pony.ai\u2019s second financing round, HongShan facilitated Nio Capital\u2019s investment in the company. Another key early investor was 5Y Capital (formerly Five Source Capital). In 2017, Zhang Fei, a partner at 5Y Capital, visited Pony.ai\u2019s Beijing office for the first time and met Peng. Peng described the meeting as a \u201cmoment of mutual understanding.\u201d Zhang\u2019s previous investment in Kuaishou became a significant reason for further discussions between 5Y Capital and Pony.ai. In its early days, Kuaishou had only one founder, Cheng Yixiao, and 5Y Capital invested RMB 2 million (USD 280,000). A year later, when Kuaishou hit a bottleneck, Zhang persuaded Su Hua to join the company by proposing a solution: both 5Y Capital and Cheng\u2019s team would dilute half their shares to create an options pool, with most of it allocated to Su\u2019s team. This was one of those rare moments where an investor altered the trajectory of a company. Zhang told 36Kr that Peng and Lou both possessed strong engineering skills and were highly pragmatic. When investing in entrepreneurs, he often worried about idealists being disconnected from reality. \u201cBut the style of these two founders is remarkably balanced,\u201d he said. Zhang believed that, in a field like autonomous driving, which requires a complete redefinition of its principles, \u201cthe only thing you can truly rely on is the team.\u201d 5Y Capital\u2019s lead investment in the Series B round was the one that truly put Pony.ai on the map in the investment community. By then, Pony.ai had already developed demonstration vehicles, and its team had grown to over 20 people. \u201cIt was an excellent fundraising round,\u201d Peng recounted, adding that his schedule was packed, meeting at least five or six investors every day. Shen Xiao, a partner at Eight Roads, recalled meeting Peng and Lou at a hotel in the US. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much preamble\u2014they opened a whiteboard right away and began discussing Level 4 technical details,\u201d Shen said. \u201cAt that time, Level 4 was still quite distant\u2014LiDAR and drive-by-wire redundancy were both far from mature.\u201d Yet, Shen Xiao told 36Kr convinced that Level 4 autonomous driving could be achieved and that it could be simplified to target Level 2 use cases. After a second meeting, Eight Roads decided to invest. Due to overwhelming investor enthusiasm, Pony.ai\u2019s valuation was adjusted over three times during this round. The Series B+ round began almost simultaneously, reaching a valuation of USD 900 million. \u201cFrom July to September, sensor solutions were being iterated constantly. The market was strong, and everyone accepted these valuation jumps,\u201d Shen Xiao said. Lin Haizhu, founding partner of G&O, noted that, before 2020, Pony.ai maintained a rhythm of raising one round every six months. When Lin engaged with the team, the Series B round had already closed. For the Series B+ round alone, over 40 term sheets were submitted, with the final selection narrowing to around ten funds. Lin, being an alumnus of the same school as Peng and Lou, leveraged that connection to join the round. Also participating in this round was Gong Biao, managing director at VMS Group, who told 36Kr that the market had very high expectations for autonomous driving. \u201cThere was a sense of competition [among investors] to secure shares\u2014better to make a mistake than miss out,\u201d Gong said. Toyota\u2019s involvement in 2020 marked a pivotal moment in Pony.ai\u2019s fundraising history. For intelligent driving companies lacking vehicle manufacturing capabilities, partnering with automakers is essential. If autonomous driving is likened to a brain, then cars are the body. \u201cNo matter how brilliant a brain is, it needs a healthy body,\u201d said Lou in an interview. In February that year, Pony.ai raised USD 400 million from Toyota at a valuation of USD 3 billion\u2014double its valuation from the previous round. The two companies\u2019 collaboration dates back to August 2019, when Pony.ai began testing on public roads in Beijing and Shanghai using Lexus RX vehicles, a Toyota subsidiary. The financing deal with Toyota was the culmination of six or seven trips Peng made to Japan over a span of half a year. Negotiations progressed gradually, moving from specific project collaborations to strategic partnerships, and finally to investment. \u201cThere was no pivotal moment or single decisive event; it was a process of slowly heating the water until it boiled,\u201d Peng said. Toyota told 36Kr that its primary motivation for investing in Pony.ai stemmed from its belief that China will remain the world\u2019s largest market for highly autonomous mobility services over the next 5\u201310 years and beyond. To accelerate the commercial deployment of robotaxi services, Toyota chose to collaborate with a local technology firm. Why did Pony.ai win Toyota\u2019s favor? According to one investor interviewed by 36Kr, another leading autonomous driving company, Roadstar, was initially closer to Toyota. However, Roadstar\u2019s internal conflicts over business strategy and equity distribution caused the company to fall apart, with its former CTO founding another startup, DeepRoute.ai. \u201cPony.ai seized the opportunity,\u201d the investor said. Peng offered a different perspective, stating that Roadstar had never even met with Toyota executives and was far from securing investment. He noted an intriguing detail: before Xiaomi officially announced its carmaking ambitions, it had also considered investing in Pony.ai. Peng had multiple discussions with Xiaomi\u2019s Lei Jun. However, Xiaomi ultimately chose to acquire Deepmotion\u2014a cheaper autonomous driving solution company\u2014for USD 500 million. \u201cXiaomi\u2019s core DNA lies in creating good products with extreme cost control and high value-for-money,\u201d a Deepmotion investor said. Pony.ai pinned its hopes on robotaxis, which needs Level 4 autonomous driving controls. Consequently, its partnership with Toyota is better described as joint development. For instance, the fifth, sixth, and seventh generation of its autonomous driving system were first installed on Toyota\u2019s vehicle platforms. That said, Toyota is not solely committed to Pony.ai. It established its own autonomous driving division in 2018 and has invested in Uber\u2019s self-driving division and Momenta in China. \u201cA top-tier company has many lives,\u201d said a Pony.ai investor, encapsulating the company\u2019s fate. After its IPO setback, a lifeline of funding fortunately arrived in March 2022, when Pony.ai announced the completion of a USD 190 million Series D round led by the China-Arab Investment Funds, with participation from OTPP, 5Y Capital, G&O, Carlyle Group, ClearVue Partners, Raumier Limited, Evodia Investment, and Assetkey Limited. In October 2023, Pony.ai announced an additional USD 100 million investment from Saudi Arabia\u2019s Neom and its investment arm, the Neom Investment Fund (NIF). Pony.ai\u2019s valuation during the Series D round was USD 8.5 billion. Sources close to the financing revealed that Middle Eastern countries, in the context of declining USD funds and increased attention to geopolitical factors, saw this as an opportunity to acquire quality companies at a discount. \u201cIn these investments, approximately 80% of the focus was on industry relevance, while the remaining 20% considered financial returns.\u201d At the time, Middle Eastern capital primarily flowed into traditional energy projects, with few technology, media, and telecommunications investments. Pony.ai was among the earliest recipients of such funding. \u201cWith USD funds drying up and RMB funds having shorter exit cycles, it\u2019s difficult to invest in projects with long commercialization paths, like autonomous driving. The Middle East is the most promising alternative,\u201d Peng told 36Kr, adding that securing Middle Eastern investment was a deliberate strategy. However, some investors contributed through a combination of new equity and secondary share purchases. One investor noted that, while buying in, the price of new equity was around USD 7 billion, while secondary shares were priced at approximately USD 1 billion. Although the top-tier positioning of Pony.ai as a leader in autonomous driving helped maintain its reputation, the real challenge lies in the secondary market. In stark contrast to its widespread appeal in the primary market, Pony.ai\u2019s Nasdaq valuation has halved from its last funding round. Multiple investors told 36Kr that the current valuation represents a consensus price range among capital market participants. Peng responded to the media outlet by stating that, while primary market valuations are driven by resources and external confidence, secondary market valuations depend on performance. \u201cIt\u2019s time to take the horse to the track and see if it runs,\u201d he said, emphasizing the need to seize the current rare IPO window. Three years ago, when Pony.ai was preparing to go public, its valuation exceeded USD 10 billion, higher than Nio\u2019s current market cap. Three years later, Pony.ai has obtained permits to operate autonomous driving services in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen with a fleet of over 250 robotaxis. Yet, its market value is less than half of its previous peak. Pony.ai\u2019s prospectus reveals the stark reality: from 2022\u20132023, the company posted net losses of USD 148 million and USD 125 million, respectively. In the first half of 2023, it reported a net loss of USD 51.78 million. The commercialization of autonomous driving appears as elusive as the \u201ciPhone moment\u201d for virtual reality (VR)\u2014perpetually anticipated, but never arriving. Secondary market investors, focused on fundamentals and valuations tied to financial metrics, are unwilling to pay for the yet-unproven robotaxi story. Six years ago, Li Jiaqing, in explaining Legend Capital\u2019s rationale for investing in Pony.ai, said, \u201cThe key question is whether this represents the most critical transformative direction. If it is, we invest, especially in early-stage, technology-driven ventures. It\u2019s hard to assess with the mindset of a mature industry. Asking upfront about business models? We don\u2019t know yet.\u201d Lu Huangxian, managing director of Redpoint China Ventures, echoed this sentiment, noting that the firm understood it was a long shot at the time of its investment. Buying into technological dreams and trading time for exponential growth was once a foundational logic for venture capital. Today, as realism and focus on fundamentals dominate the narrative, late-stage investors who once flocked to unicorns must now confront micro-profits\u2014or even losses. If the internet funding frenzy was a flowing banquet of capital, Pony.ai exemplifies the fate of a technology company when its investors return from dreams to reality. A confluence of factors shaped its trajectory: shifting US-China relations, changing investor preferences, difficulties in fundraising, and the rise of a \u201cDPI above all\u201d mentality. But this was no accident\u2014it might even become the norm. The more pressing question is whether extreme realism is correct. What kind of capital environment does true innovation require? It\u2019s worth remembering that autonomous driving emerged from a daydream. One Pony.ai investor told 36Kr that having the right assets is more important than timing. Perhaps this is a form of self-consolation. They might still recall the story of Pinduoduo: valued at under USD 30 billion on its IPO day, it dipped below its offering price at least four times in its first year, yet now exceeds USD 130 billion in market capitalization. Perhaps Pony.ai\u2019s public listing is just the beginning. Over two months ago, renowned angel investor and Neu Venture Capital founder Jerry Neumann announced that he would no longer invest in new startups. In his farewell to a career as an individual venture capitalist, Neumann said that today\u2019s startups no longer feel like they are driving progress but have become more about running a business. Perhaps, that is but a reflection of the current investment climate. KrASIA Connection features translated and adapted content that was originally published by 36Kr.

        "Extracted Text": "KEY POINTS With investor enthusiasm in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks currently as strong as ever, there's significant interest in new opportunities like Pony AI (PONY 9.67%) stock. A developer of proprietary software that enables autonomous mobility, Pony AI became one of the latest AI stocks available to investors after the company completed its initial public offering (IPO) in November 2024. Operating a fleet of more than 250 robotaxis, which have amassed a total of about 33.5 million kilometers of autonomous driving mileage, Pony AI also operates a fleet of more than 190 robotrucks. While the majority of the company's business is in China -- business research firm Frost & Sullivan recognizes it as the sole autonomous driving technology company that has received all available regulatory permits necessary for offering robotaxi services to the public within China's Tier\u20111 cities -- it also has operations in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East, demonstrating a global presence. Since the stock is new to the market, potential AI investors surely have plenty of questions, such as whether Pony AI is profitable, whether it pays a dividend, and if there are exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that include it among their holdings. For those who believe in the merits of going for a ride with Pony AI stock, there are a few simple steps to take. Since individual investing goals vary, it's impossible to say categorically whether an investment in Pony AI is right for everyone. However, there are certainly several reasons why investors would find it worthwhile to gain exposure to Pony AI stock. For one, those seeking an AI investment -- or even diversity in the sort of AI investments they have chosen -- will be drawn to the stock. From semiconductor stocks to companies that develop generative AI models, there are various opportunities for AI investments. Pony AI, a developer of proprietary AI software that enables autonomous ability, is yet another option. Despite the many reasons why Pony AI stock may be alluring for some, there are a couple of reasons that investors may lose interest in it. For one, the company is headquartered in China, where its business is primarily located. Investors interested in minimizing their exposure to China-based stocks will find Pony AI unappealing. Conservative investors also will likely be uninterested in Pony AI stock. Because the company -- currently unprofitable -- is still in the growth phase of its development, there are a variety of risks associated with an investment, so people looking to minimize their exposure to risk would be better off looking elsewhere. Based on a regulatory filing for the IPO of its American depositary shares, Pony AI was unprofitable in 2022 and 2023. On a gross profit basis, the company is in the black, posting gross profits of $32.1 million and $16.9 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The bottom of the income statement, however, tells a different story. The company reported net losses in each of the previous two years: $148.3 million in 2022 and $125.3 million in 2023. While the company's still reporting a net loss, it's worth noting that it has made headway toward generating profits. For the six-month period ending June 30, 2024, Pony AI reported a net profit margin of negative 209.5%, notably better than the negative 566.3% it posted for the same period in 2023. As of the end of 2024, Pony AI hadn't paid a dividend to shareholders. Between the company's inability to generate both profits and positive operational cash flow -- it reported $154.8 million in 2022 and $115.4 million net cash used in operating activities -- it's highly unlikely that Pony AI will return capital to shareholders by way of dividends anytime soon. Since Pony AI recently appeared on public markets, the stock hasn't yet appeared among the holdings of exchange-traded funds (ETF). Other options exist, however, as there are several artificial intelligence (AI) ETFs that may interest investors. Companies often decide to split their stocks when they believe that the share price is so high that it's preventing some investors from buying them. There are a variety of upcoming stock splits, but it is incredibly unlikely that Pony AI will be one of them.

Clean energy is the future, and these companies are leading the way. New ideas are the way to make money in the markets. Find inspiration here. A new option for those interested in self-driving car exposure, Pony AI has already made significant inroads in advancing autonomous mobility in China, Europe, and the Middle East. Before buying Pony AI stock or an ETF that presents exposure to the autonomous mobility industry, it's important to recognize the ample risks associated with these types of investments. Although Pony AI is generating revenue, there's no guarantee that it will achieve profitability. RELATED ARTICLES Invest better with The Motley Fool.

In December 2021, California DMV suspended a driverless testing permit for Pony.ai following this accident. It is the first time for DMV to issue such a suspension.[11] Subsequently, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a probe.[12] More than four months after the accident, the NHTSA announced the \"first recall of an automated driving system\" as the company complied with the government agency\u2019s request.[13] In May 2022, California DMV revoked Pony.ai's permit for failing to monitor the driving records of the safety drivers on its testing permit.[14] As of June 2023, Pony.ai is back to testing its fleet with safety drivers present in California.[6] According to the California DMV, in 2021 Pony.ai had the third-highest number of miles driven, behind Waymo and Cruise.[15] In April 2022, Pony.ai became the first autonomous driving company to get a taxi license in China.[16] In July 2022, Pony.ai partnered with equipment manufacturer Sany Heavy Industry to mass produce autonomous driving trucks in China.[17] In April 2023, Pony.ai was licensed to operate robotaxi services in Guangzhou.[18] In August 2023, Toyota and Pony.ai developed plans to mass produce robotaxis in China. The two companies and GAC-Toyota, a venture between the Japanese automaker and Chinese state-owned Guangzhou Automobile Group, will invest more than 1 billion yuan ($140 million) combined.[19] In January 2018, Pony.ai completed a $112 million Series A round co-led by Morningside Venture Capital and Legend Capital with seed round lead-investor Sequoia China and investor IDG Capital also participating in the round, alongside Hongtai Capital, Legend Star, Puhua Capital, Polaris Capital, DCM Ventures, Comcast Ventures and Silicon Valley Future Capital.[20] In February 2020, Toyota invested $400 million in the company as part of a funding round of $462 million.[21] Toyota previously announced that it was working with Pony.ai to test self-driving cars on public roads in Beijing and Shanghai.[22] As of 2020, the company had a valuation of $5.3 billion.[23] The company intended to go public on the New York Stock Exchange via an SPAC route. However, in 2021, the company suspended its plans due to Chinese regulators.[24] In October 2023, Pony.ai received $100 million from Neom, Saudi Arabia, to develop, manufacture and deploy autonomous vehicles and smart infrastructure in Neom and the MENA region. The agreement includes the establishment of a regional R&D and manufacturing headquarters.[25] In November 2024, Pony.ai held its initial public offering (IPO) and became a listed company on the Nasdaq raising $260 million. This is one of the largest IPOs in the United States stock market involving autonomous driving sector.[26] Shares 15% opened above their offer price in their market debut.[27]",
