      "content": "Down , This Growth Stock Could Be Set for a Recovery in Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool November , min read In This Article: AMPL - Tech stocks saw a boom year in as they soared through the tail end of the pandemic. But tech stocks that went public during that year got stuck between a bull and bear market. Amplitude (NASDAQ: AMPL) is one such example. The software-as-a-service stock, which specializes in digital analytics and digital product optimization, went public in September . The stock initially soared out of the gate on the broader enthusiasm for the software sector and the company's strong growth at the time of its market debut. Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free » However, like the rest of the software sector, its growth rate rapidly slowed as the economy reopened and businesses focused on other priorities. The stock plunged in late and , and has remained down since then. Amplitude is now down from its peak shortly after its initial public offering, but signs are emerging of a rebound. Let's take a look at three reasons the stock could jump in . Image source: Getty Images. . Customer churn is finally under control Part of the reason for the company's struggles over the last few years is that many of its customers, like other software companies experienced, overcommitted to the platform -- and as a result, revenue growth decelerated and remained weak since . However, the company is now past most of those customers' defections, essentially clearing the deck for a growth recovery in . CEO Spenser Skates said on the earnings call: ... ARR [annual recurring revenue] and revenue reacceleration are both well within our reach. This quarter sets us firmly on that path. While we are making progress, there is still plenty of work to do. We are past the significant majority of overbought to optimization contracts, but churn is still too high. Annual recurring revenue in the quarter was up to million, slightly ahead of reported quarterly revenue, which was up to million -- a positive sign for accelerating growth. The company continues to expand its base of large customers; those with annual recurring revenue of at least were up to . Amplitude's revenue growth figure was artificially suppressed by the post-pandemic customer churn and as that disappears, its growth rate should return to double digits. As one indicator of that, its remaining performance obligations (RPO, a proxy for backlog) was up in the quarter to million, and long-term RPO (contracts greater than months) jumped to million. The company said this was the result of closer relationships with its customers and investments in the enterprise segment, meaning larger customers. . It may pry customers away from competitors Amplitude offers a suite of tools to help businesses understand how their customers are using their products so they can improve them, and considers its closest competition to be Alphabet's Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics. According to CEO Spenser Skates, Amplitude's customers are growing increasingly dissatisfied with Google Analytics, which Skates said was \"creating a long tail of opportunities for Amplitude\" as customers are \"dissatisfied with its [Google's] persistent usability problems and unresolved privacy issues.\" Amplitude can grow along with the market for digital optimization, but it can also grow by taking market share from larger competitors like Google and Adobe. The company estimated its total addressable market to be billion when it went public, and it's likely larger than that today. At its current revenue run rate, Amplitude generates less than of that in revenue, meaning the opportunity in front of it is huge if it can capitalize on it. Any challenges at Google Analytics should open the door for improved revenue growth. . The Command AI acquisition should boost growth Amplitude made its biggest acquisition to date in October, buying Command AI, a start-up that provides AI-powered user assistance. Command AI serves as a complement to Amplitude's existing analytics platform, and offers more of the features that its customers are looking for. It will allow them to add things like nudges, tours, onboarding guides, and surveys for their own users to use with their digital products. In an interview with The Motley Fool, Skates explained, \"A lot of our customers have been asking for this sort of functionality for a while,\" and noted that the company is planning to launch a combined product early next year. Command AI is just one component of what Amplitude is doing to expand its product portfolio. The company also launched a new program called Amplitude Made Easy, which gives customers a single line of code to get up and running, and Web Experimentation, which allows users to run A/B tests in a self-serve way. Overall, Amplitude's third-quarter revenue growth of isn't going to turn investors' heads. But you can see momentum building around the corner in its RPO growth, customer churn rolling off, competitive weakness from Google, and product improvements. If revenue growth starts to accelerate, the stock could soar. Should you invest in Amplitude right now?

(NASDAQ:AMPL) institutional owners after losing over the past year editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) January , min read In This Article: AMPL Key Insights Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Amplitude's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions The top shareholders own of the company Insiders own of Amplitude Every investor in Amplitude, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). Last week's USm market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of losses. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Amplitude. Check out our latest analysis for Amplitude NasdaqCM:AMPL Ownership Breakdown January th What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amplitude? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. Amplitude already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Amplitude, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. NasdaqCM:AMPL Earnings and Revenue Growth January th Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Amplitude. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Sequoia Capital Operations LLC with of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about and of the stock. Additionally, the company's CEO Spenser Skates directly holds of the total shares outstanding. We did some more digging and found that of the top shareholders account for roughly of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. Insider Ownership Of Amplitude The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Amplitude, Inc.. Insiders own USm worth of shares in the USb company. That's quite meaningful. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public Ownership With a ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Amplitude. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. Private Equity Ownership Private equity firms hold a stake in Amplitude. This suggests they can be influential in key policy decisions. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public. Next Steps: I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted warning signs for Amplitude (of which is significant!) you should know about. But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

(Nasdaq: CMPO), a leader in metal payment cards, security, and authentication solutions, released the industry’s first tap-to- authenticate report in collaboration with PYMNTS Intelligence, a leading payments analyst organization. The report identified the top security challenges facing financial institutions (FIs), reporting that of financial institutions saw a rise in stolen credentials as fraud cases surge. “The PYMNTS Intelligence report underscores that the time for decisive action is now, with nearly of FIs recognizing the urgent need for improved security measures,” said Adam Lowe, Chief Product and Innovation Officer at CompoSecure. “There is growing sentiment among FIs that passwordless and physical authentication methods represent the future of financial security as credential-based fraud continues to accelerate.” The report highlights that the current inconsistency in authentication methods across various transactions has proven inadequate for FIs, creating both security gaps and a poor user experience.

Tap-to- authenticate payment cards, such as CompoSecure’s Arculus Authenticate, a multi-functional security solution on a chip-enabled card, doubles as both an authentication passkey and payment card to offer a simpler, more secure alternative to other authentication methods. According to the report, of heads of fraud believe Arculus-like devices will reduce fraud and false positives, and of heads of product see reduced friction in customer authentication. Arculus Authenticate tackles identity challenges directly: users tap their card on their phone for secure logins or transactions, eliminating the need for SMS or app-based verification. Among FIs already using metal cards, believe they would see improved customer experience and loyalty, perceive ROI potential, and anticipate higher profits and improved security by adding tap- to-authenticate technology. “The report highlights a significant challenge for financial institutions and signals that current security measures may no longer suffice in today’s digital landscape,” added Lowe. The PYMNTS Intelligence report used quantitative data and feedback from financial institution executives in fraud prevention, product development, and cybersecurity roles. The analysis evaluated current fraud patterns, authentication protocols, and the anticipated ROI of advanced authentication strategies. By examining these findings in-depth, the report sheds light on effective countermeasures and the potential of next-generation security tools.

      "content": "Wall Street Analysts Predict a Upside in Weave Communications (WEAV): Here's What You Should Know Zacks Equity Research November , min read In This Article: WEAV - Shares of Weave Communications, Inc. (WEAV) have gained over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at , but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of indicates a potential upside of . The average comprises seven short-term price targets ranging from a low of to a high of , with a standard deviation of . While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts. While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. But, for WEAV, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside. Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading. While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why? They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts. However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces. That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism. Why WEAV Could Witness a Solid Upside Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased over the past month, as four estimates have gone higher compared to no negative revision. Moreover, WEAV currently has a Zacks Rank # (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top of more than the stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank # (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much WEAV could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.

      "content": "Vianet (VNET) Moves to Strong Buy: Rationale Behind the Upgrade Zacks Equity Research January , min read In This Article: VNET + Vianet (VNET) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank # (Strong Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change. The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Vianet is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock. For Vianet, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank # (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank # (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank # stocks generating an average annual return of + since . You can see the complete list of today's Zacks # Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>. Earnings Estimate Revisions for Vianet For the fiscal year ending December , this provider of carrier-neutral internet data center services is expected to earn - per share, which is a change of from the year-ago reported number. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Vianet. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased . Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term. You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>> The upgrade of Vianet to a Zacks Rank # positions it in the top of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

(EGHT) Reports Surge in AI-Powered CX Adoption, Enhances Contact Center Solutions Affan Mir Wed, Feb , , : AM min read In This Article: EGHT + We recently compiled a list of the AI News and Ratings You Should Take a Look At. In this article, we are going to take a look at where x, Inc. (NASDAQ:EGHT) stands against the other AI stocks. AI Accessibility and Global Growth In a CNBC interview, Clement Delangue, CEO of Hugging Face, discussed some important developments in the AI industry and focused on OpenAI, DeepSeek, and the role of open-source innovation. He noted the increasing global attention on AI and the discussions surrounding major industry shifts but emphasized that his priority remains on actual AI development rather than business transactions. He welcomed efforts to make OpenAI more open-source-oriented and stated that greater contributions to open science could have a significant global impact. Delangue talked about the rapid rise of DeepSeek, whose open-source model has gained widespread adoption, with over a thousand variants developed and millions of downloads on Hugging Face. He pointed out that DeepSeek’s model has already surpassed Llama and Mistral in popularity and is on track to become the most widely used model on the platform. Unlike proprietary AI services that cater to API users, DeepSeek primarily attracts AI builders who run and customize models independently. He suggested this segment could eventually outgrow the user base of API-driven AI platforms. Delangue also affirmed that DeepSeek’s reported million training cost and lower inference expenses appear accurate. He praised its detailed research paper and the transparency enabled by open-source releases, which allow others to replicate its results. Hugging Face is working on its own replication effort, OpenR, to provide further transparency on training data and methodologies, making it accessible to developers with limited budgets. Moreover, Delangue acknowledged DeepSeek’s ability to train models using less advanced, legally compliant chips but left open the possibility that it had access to more sophisticated hardware. He noted, however, that AI advancements in training efficiency could reduce reliance on high-end chips, promoting broader accessibility in the field. Finally, Delangue observed that DeepSeek’s success has inspired greater ambition in many countries, including Europe, where governments are increasing AI investments. He sees a growing consensus on the benefits of open-source AI. He also noted that China’s AI progress, while surprising to some, was predictable due to its increasing contributions to open-source AI and research. He suggested that other countries, including India, could follow a similar approach to accelerate their AI capabilities and compete at the highest levels.
