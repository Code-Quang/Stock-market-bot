        "Extracted Text": "Financial Highlights Operational Highlights SEOUL, South Korea--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation (NYSE: MX) (\u201cMagnachip\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) today announced financial results for the third quarter 2024. YJ Kim, Magnachip\u2019s CEO, commented, \u201cOur Q3 revenue was at the high-end of guidance driven by broad-based growth in our Standard Product businesses, which is comprised of our MSS and PAS businesses. Standard Product revenue increased 25.9% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. Our discrete Power business benefited from leaner inventory in distribution channels as well as new product designs wins resulting in better-than-seasonal growth. In MSS, the strong sequential growth was due to increased demand for products targeted for China smartphone OEMs, automotive displays, and OLED IT.\u201d YJ Kim added, \u201cLooking ahead, we expect our Standard Product business revenue in Q4 will modestly decline sequentially, which is better than typical seasonality experienced in past years. We reiterate our full-year guidance for double-digit growth in both MSS and PAS businesses in 2024.\u201d Q3 2024 Financial Highlights In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share data GAAP Q3 2024 Q2 2024 Q/Q change Q3 2023 Y/Y change Consolidated Revenues 66,460 53,171 up 25.0 % 61,245 up 8.5 % Standard Products Business 64,020 50,835 up 25.9 % 51,619 up 24.0 % Mixed-Signal Solutions 16,446 11,595 up 41.8 % 10,644 up 54.5 % Power Analog Solutions 47,574 39,240 up 21.2 % 40,975 up 16.1 % Transitional Fab 3 foundry services(1) 2,440 2,336 up 4.5 % 9,626 down 74.7 % Consolidated Gross Profit Margin 23.3 21.8 % up 1.5 %pts 23.6 % down 0.3 %pts Standard Products Business 24.4 23.1 % up 1.3 %pts 28.7 % down 4.3 %pts Mixed-Signal Solutions 38.7 % 34.6 % up 4.1 %pts 28.8 % up 9.9 %pts Power Analog Solutions 19.4 % 19.7 % down 0.3 %pts 28.6 % down 9.2 %pts Operating Loss (11,003 ) (12,824 ) up n/a (9,235 ) down n/a Net Loss (9,617 ) (12,997 ) up n/a (5,165 ) down n/a Basic Loss per Common Share (0.26 ) (0.34 ) up n/a (0.13 ) down n/a Diluted Loss per Common Share (0.26 ) (0.34 ) up n/a (0.13 ) down n/a In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share data Non-GAAP(2) Q3 2024 Q2 2024 Q/Q change Q3 2023 Y/Y change Adjusted Operating Loss (9,026 ) (11,608 ) up n/a (7,064 ) down n/a Adjusted EBITDA (4,949 ) (7,569 ) up n/a (2,735 ) down n/a Adjusted Net Loss (12,797 ) (8,134 ) down n/a (1,591 ) down n/a Adjusted Loss per Common Share\u2014Diluted (0.34 ) (0.21 ) down n/a (0.04 ) down n/a ___________ Following the consummation of the sale of the Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 in Q3 2020, we provided transitional foundry services to the buyer for foundry products manufactured in our fabrication facility located in Gumi, Korea, known as \u201cFab 3\u201d (\u201cTransitional Fab 3 Foundry Services\u201d). The contractual obligation to provide the Transitional Fab 3 Foundry Services ended August 31, 2023, and we are winding down these foundry services and have begun to convert portions of the idle capacity to PAS products during the second half of 2024. Because these foundry services during the wind-down period are still provided to the same buyer by us using our Fab 3 based on mutually agreed terms and conditions, we will continue to report our revenue from providing these foundry services and related cost of sales within the Transitional Fab 3 Foundry Services line in our consolidated statement of operations until such wind down is completed. Management believes that disclosing revenue of Transitional Fab 3 Foundry Services separately from the standard products business allows investors to better understand the results of our core standard products MSS and PAS businesses. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed in conjunction with GAAP results, can provide a meaningful understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business and operations and assist in evaluating our core operating performance. However, such non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered as a substitute for net loss or as a better indicator of our operating performance than measures that are presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results is included in this press release. Q4 and Full-year 2024 Financial Guidance Beginning in Q1 of 2024, the Company began reporting results under its newly organized businesses: MSS (Mixed-Signal Solutions) and PAS (Power Analog Solutions). While actual results may vary, Magnachip currently expects the following: For Q4 2024: For the full-year 2024, we currently expect: Q3 2024 Earnings Conference Call Magnachip will host a corresponding conference call at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, October 30, 2024, to discuss its financial results.

We define Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated as EBITDA (as defined below), adjusted to exclude (i) Equity-based compensation expense, (ii) Foreign currency loss (gain), net, (iii) Derivative valuation loss (gain), net and (iv) Early termination and other charges. EBITDA for the periods indicated is defined as net loss before interest income, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization. We prepare Adjusted Net Loss by adjusting net loss to eliminate the impact of a number of non-cash expenses and other items that may be either one time or recurring that we do not consider to be indicative of our core ongoing operating performance. We believe that Adjusted Net Loss is particularly useful because it reflects the impact of our asset base and capital structure on our operating performance. We define Adjusted Net Loss for the periods as net loss, adjusted to exclude (i) Equity-based compensation expense, (ii) Foreign currency loss (gain), net, (iii) Derivative valuation loss (gain), net, (iv) Early termination and other charges and (v) Income tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded in our consolidated statement of operations $8,449 thousand of termination related charges in connection with the voluntary resignation program that we offered to certain employees during the first quarter of 2023. During the same period, we also recorded $802 thousand of one-time employee incentives. Steven C. Pelayo, CFA The Blueshirt Group Tel. +1 (360) 808-5154 steven@blueshirtgroup.co Steven C.

YJ Kim, Magnachip\u2019s CEO, commented, \u201cOur Q2 revenue was above the mid-point of guidance and gross margin was better than expected. Revenue in our Standard Products Business, which is comprised of our MSS and PAS businesses, increased sequentially by double digits in Q2. We benefited from a recovery in our Power business, increased demand for OLED drivers for China smartphones and European autos, and an upturn in Power IC demand for OLED IT panels and LED TVs.\u201d YJ Kim added, \u201cLooking ahead, we currently expect Standard Product Business revenue will increase sequentially once again in Q3, driven by leaner distribution channels in Power, as well as seasonality, and an increase in OLED and Power IC businesses.\u201d Q2 2024 Financial Highlights In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share data GAAP Q2 2024 Q1 2024 Q/Q change Q2 2023 Y/Y change Consolidated Revenues 53,171 49,067 up 8.4 % 60,979 down 12.8 % Standard Products Business 50,835 45,541 up 11.6 % 51,375 down 1.1 % Mixed-Signal Solutions 11,595 9,006 up 28.7 % 12,357 down 6.2 % Power Analog Solutions 39,240 36,535 up 7.4 % 39,018 up 0.6 % Transitional Fab 3 foundry services(1) 2,336 3,526 down 33.7 % 9,604 down 75.7 % Consolidated Gross Profit Margin 21.8 % 18.3 % up 3.5 %pts 22.2 % down 0.4 %pts Standard Products Business 23.1 % 21.2 % up 1.9 %pts 26.3 % down 3.2 %pts Mixed-Signal Solutions 34.6 % 44.6 % down 10.0 %pts 36.4 % down 1.8 %pts Power Analog Solutions 19.7 % 15.4 % up 4.3 %pts 23.1 % down 3.4 %pts Operating Loss (12,824 ) (13,459 ) up n/a (10,656 ) down n/a Net Loss (12,997 ) (15,417 ) up n/a (3,947 ) down n/a Basic Loss per Common Share (0.34 ) (0.40 ) up n/a (0.09 ) down n/a Diluted Loss per Common Share (0.34 ) (0.40 ) up n/a (0.09 ) down n/a In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share data Non-GAAP(2) Q2 2024 Q1 2024 Q/Q change Q2 2023 Y/Y change Adjusted Operating Loss (11,608 ) (12,559 ) up n/a (7,762 ) down n/a Adjusted EBITDA (7,569 ) (8,441 ) up n/a (3,594 ) down n/a Adjusted Net Loss (8,134 ) (10,884 ) up n/a (2,472 ) down n/a Adjusted Loss per Common Share\u2014Diluted (0.21 ) (0.28 ) up n/a (0.06 ) down n/a ___________ (1) Following the consummation of the sale of the Foundry Services Group business and Fab 4 in Q3 2020, we provided transitional foundry services to the buyer for foundry products manufactured in our fabrication facility located in Gumi, Korea, known as \u201cFab 3\u201d (\u201cTransitional Fab 3 Foundry Services\u201d). The contractual obligation to provide the Transitional Fab 3 Foundry Services ended August 31, 2023, and we are winding down these foundry services and planning to convert portions of the idle capacity to PAS products beginning around the second half of 2024. Because these foundry services during the wind-down period are still provided to the same buyer by us using our Fab 3 based on mutually agreed terms and conditions, we will continue to report our revenue from providing these foundry services and related cost of sales within the Transitional Fab 3 Foundry Services line in our consolidated statement of operations until such wind down is completed. Management believes that disclosing revenue of Transitional Fab 3 Foundry Services separately from the standard products business allows investors to better understand the results of our core standard products MSS and PAS businesses. (2) Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed in conjunction with GAAP results, can provide a meaningful understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business and operations and assist in evaluating our core operating performance. However, such non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered as a substitute for net loss or as a better indicator of our operating performance than measures that are presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results is included in this press release. Q3 and Full-year 2024 Financial Guidance Beginning in Q1, the Company began reporting results under its newly organized businesses: MSS (Mixed-Signal Solutions) and PAS (Power Analog Solutions). While actual results may vary, Magnachip currently expects the following: For Q3 2024: For the full-year 2024, we currently expect: Q2 2024 Earnings Conference Call Magnachip will host a corresponding conference call at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 31, 2024, to discuss its financial results.

We define Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated as EBITDA (as defined below), adjusted to exclude (i) Equity-based compensation expense, (ii) Foreign currency loss (gain), net, (iii) Derivative valuation loss (gain), net and (iv) Early termination and other charges. EBITDA for the periods indicated is defined as net loss before interest income, interest expense, income tax benefit and depreciation and amortization. We prepare Adjusted Net Loss by adjusting net loss to eliminate the impact of a number of non-cash expenses and other items that may be either one time or recurring that we do not consider to be indicative of our core ongoing operating performance. We believe that Adjusted Net Loss is particularly useful because it reflects the impact of our asset base and capital structure on our operating performance. We define Adjusted Net Loss for the periods as net loss, adjusted to exclude (i) Equity-based compensation expense, (ii) Foreign currency loss (gain), net, (iii) Derivative valuation loss (gain), net, (iv) Early termination and other charges and (v) Income tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments.

        "Extracted Text": "Gross profit margin surged, but there weren't a lot of sales to profit from. Shares of South Korean semiconductor manufacturer MagnaChip Semiconductor (MX -0.22%) jumped out of the gate Monday and are up 4.3% as of 11:30 a.m. EDT after the company crushed its third-quarter earnings report this morning. Heading into the third quarter, analysts had forecast that MagnaChip would earn $0.22 per share on $126.9 million in sales. As it turned out, the company just barely reached that sales target, booking $127 million in revenue. However, MagnaChip took a woodchipper to earnings projections, reporting a per-share profit of $0.42 per share and sending the shares flying. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Granted, that was only a pro forma number. Actual earnings when calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) were only $0.23 per share. And MagnaChip's sales inched only up 1.8% year over year in Q3 2021. The company's display solutions sales were especially weak, falling nearly 16% year over year, a fact the company attributed to \"limited ... foundry capacity allocation amid global shortages in manufacturing capacities.\" On the plus side, the company's gross profit margin on those sales grew by more than half to 36.7%, hitting \"the highest level reported in the company's history.\" The really bad news for MagnaChip investors, I fear, is that management says its \"supply constraint is expected to persist for the foreseeable future,\" limiting its ability to grow revenue to which those strong gross margin numbers can be applied. MagnaChip management didn't provide investors guidance on precisely how bad things could look later this year, but analysts are still forecasting a sizable falloff in revenue for the fourth quarter (down 7%) and an even bigger decline in earnings (down more than 40%).

        "Extracted Text": "Look here for a clue. There's no foolproof way to know the future for MagnaChip Semiconductor (NYSE: MX) or any other company. However, certain clues may help you see potential stumbles before they happen -- and before your stock craters as a result. A cloudy crystal ball In this series, we use accounts receivable and days sales outstanding to judge a company's current health and future prospects. It's an important step in separating the pretenders from the market's best stocks. Alone, AR -- the amount of money owed the company -- and DSO -- the number of days' worth of sales owed to the company -- don't tell you much. However, by considering the trends in AR and DSO, you can sometimes get a window onto the future. Sometimes, problems with AR or DSO simply indicate a change in the business (like an acquisition), or lax collections. However, AR that grows more quickly than revenue, or ballooning DSO, can, at times, suggest a desperate company that's trying to boost sales by giving its customers overly generous payment terms. Alternately, it can indicate that the company sprinted to book a load of sales at the end of the quarter, like used-car dealers on the 29th of the month. (Sometimes, companies do both.) Why might an upstanding firm like MagnaChip Semiconductor do this? For the same reason any other company might: to make the numbers. Investors don't like revenue shortfalls, and employees don't like reporting them to their superiors. Is MagnaChip Semiconductor sending any potential warning signs? Take a look at the chart below, which plots revenue growth against AR growth, and DSO: Source: S&P Capital IQ. Data is current as of last fully reported fiscal quarter. FQ = fiscal quarter. The standard way to calculate DSO uses average accounts receivable. I prefer to look at end-of-quarter receivables, but I've plotted both above. When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 959% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 178% for the S&P 500. They just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now, available when you join Stock Advisor. *Stock Advisor returns as of February 13, 2025 Watching the trends When that red line (AR growth) crosses above the green line (revenue growth), I know I need to consult the filings. Similarly, a spike in the blue bars indicates a trend worth worrying about. MagnaChip Semiconductor's latest average DSO stands at 61.6 days, and the end-of-quarter figure is 60.5 days. Differences in business models can generate variations in DSO, and business needs can require occasional fluctuations, but all things being equal, I like to see this figure stay steady. So, let's get back to our original question: Based on DSO and sales, does MagnaChip Semiconductor look like it might miss its numbers in the next quarter or two? I don't think so. AR and DSO look healthy. For the last fully reported fiscal quarter, MagnaChip Semiconductor's year-over-year revenue grew 20.6%, and its AR grew 13.8%. That looks OK. End-of-quarter DSO decreased 5.6% from the prior-year quarter. It was down 1.8% versus the prior quarter. Still, I'm no fortuneteller, and these are just numbers. Investors putting their money on the line always need to dig into the filings for the root causes and draw their own conclusions. Is MagnaChip Semiconductor the best semiconductor stock for you?

        "Extracted Text": "There are deals to be had in the semiconductor industry, and Magnachip has become a buyout target in recent weeks. Shares of South Korean chipmaker Magnachip Semiconductor (MX -0.22%) were up by 14.3% as of noon ET Wednesday. There was no specific news from the company that drove that jump. However, rumors emerged Wednesday morning that it had been approached with a buyout offer from South Korean conglomerate LX Group and private equity firm Carlyle Group (CG 1.45%). IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. This news wasn't exactly new. Last month, South Korean media outlets reported on indications that LX Group was interested in buying Magnachip. However, Wednesday's report suggests the acquisition price could be around $25 a share -- 26% above the current stock price. Bear in mind that neither the buyout nor that offer price has been confirmed by either company. Nevertheless, it isn't a stretch to think there's interest in Magnachip. Semiconductor stocks have been blasted this year as investors worry about the possibility of an economic slowdown, or worse, a downturn. Even as this concern grows, though, many electrical component companies are scrambling to keep up with booming demand and are reporting record sales amid a global chip shortage. Magnachip is not one of the chipmakers enjoying resurging sales. The company, which supplies display parts for TVs and other consumer electronics, reported a 15% year-over-year decline in sales in Q1 2022 due to supply chain issues. In spite of the company's recent woes, institutional investors still see value in Magnachip. The stock presently trades for less than 13 times trailing 12-month earnings. Magnachip isn't the only semiconductor stock trading on the cheap right now. With the market swooning but chip demand expected to rise throughout the next decade, there are lots of deals to be had among designers and manufacturers of technology's basic building blocks.

MagnaChip Semiconductor stock traders use a variety of tools to make a prediction on which way the MX market is likely to head next. These tools can roughly be divided into indicators and chart patterns. When trying to make a MagnaChip Semiconductor stock forecast, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall. Moving averages are among the most popular MagnaChip Semiconductor stock prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for MX stock over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for MX is a sum of MX\u2019s closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12. In addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action. 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the stock market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the MagnaChip Semiconductor stock price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for MagnaChip Semiconductor stock. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually interpreted as a negative forecast for the MX market. Traders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the MagnaChip Semiconductor stock price. When making a MagnaChip Semiconductor stock forecast, most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of MagnaChip Semiconductor stock with different granularity \u2013 for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremely short-term price action or choose a weekly candlestick chart to identify long-terms trends. 1-hour, 4-hour and 1-day candlestick charts are among the most popular. Let\u2019s use a 1-hour candlestick chart as an example of how this type of price chart gives us information about opening and closing prices. The chart is divided into \u201ccandles\u201d that give us information about MagnaChip Semiconductor\u2019s stock price action in 1-hour chunks. Each candlestick will display MX\u2019s opening price, closing price, as well as the highest and lowest prices that MagnaChip Semiconductor reached within the 1-hour period. This information makes it easier to make an informed price prediction. It\u2019s also important to pay attention to the color of the candle \u2013 a green candle means that the closing price was higher than the opening price, while a red candle tells us the opposite. Some charts will use hollow and filled candlestick bodies instead of colors to represent the same thing. Just like with any other asset, the price action of MagnaChip Semiconductor stock is driven by supply and demand. These dynamics can be influenced by fundamental factors, such as earnings announcements, new product launches, acquisitions and mergers, and other factors. The MX stock price can also be influenced by market sentiment, broader economic conditions, interest rates, inflation rates and political developments. Some traders try to identify candlestick patterns when making stock price predictions to try and get an edge over the competition. Some candlestick formations are seen as likely to forecast bullish price action, while others are seen as bearish.

While amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets is excluded, the revenues from acquired companies is reflected in the Company\u2019s non-GAAP measures and these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Management believes the presentation of operating results that exclude certain items provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of the Company\u2019s core operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods. Management also uses adjusted EBITDA, which represents GAAP net income (loss), adjusted for net interest expense; income tax expense; depreciation and amortization expense; share-based compensation expense; acquisition-related inventory adjustments; diligence, acquisition and integration expense; restructure charges; impairment of goodwill; changes in the fair value of contingent consideration; gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and other infrequent or unusual items. Beginning in 2024, for our non-GAAP reporting, we are utilizing a long-term projected non-GAAP effective tax rate of 28%, which includes the tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments and reflects currently available information as well as other factors and assumptions. While we expect to use this normalized non-GAAP effective tax rate through 2024, this long-term non-GAAP effective tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or changes to our strategy or business operations. Our GAAP effective tax can vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, discrete items which are recorded in the period they occur, the tax effects of certain items of income or expense, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or changes to our strategy or business operations. We are unable to predict the timing and amounts of these items, which could significantly impact our GAAP effective tax rate, and therefore we are unable to reconcile our forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate measure to our GAAP effective tax rate. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, as they exclude important information about SGH\u2019s financial results, as noted above. The presentation of these adjusted amounts varies from amounts presented in accordance with GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to amounts reported by other companies. In addition, adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used for, operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be used as a measure of liquidity. Investors are encouraged to review the \u201cReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\u201d tables below.

These and other risks, uncertainties and factors are described in greater detail under the sections titled \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates,\u201d \u201cResults of Operations,\u201d \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d and \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d contained in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the Company\u2019s other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, such risks, uncertainties and factors as outlined above and in such filings do not constitute all risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause actual results of SGH to be materially different from such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that the Company makes in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release. Except as required by law, SGH does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements contained in this press release to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that may arise after the date that the forward-looking statements were made. Statement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures SGH management uses non-GAAP measures to supplement SGH\u2019s financial results under GAAP. Management uses these measures to analyze its operations and make decisions as to future operational plans and believes that this supplemental non-GAAP information is useful to investors in analyzing and assessing the Company\u2019s past and future operating performance. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain items, such as share-based compensation expense; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets (consisting of amortization of developed technology, customer relationships, trademarks/trade names and backlog acquired in connection with business combinations); acquisition-related inventory adjustments; diligence, acquisition and integration expense; restructure charges; impairment of goodwill; changes in the fair value of contingent consideration; gains (losses) from changes in currency exchange rates; amortization of debt discount and other costs; gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt; other infrequent or unusual items and related tax effects and other tax adjustments. While amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets is excluded, the revenues from acquired companies is reflected in the Company\u2019s non-GAAP measures and these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Management believes the presentation of operating results that exclude certain items provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of the Company\u2019s core operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods. Management also uses adjusted EBITDA, which represents GAAP net income (loss), adjusted for net interest expense; income tax expense; depreciation and amortization expense; share-based compensation expense; acquisition-related inventory adjustments; diligence, acquisition and integration expense; restructure charges; impairment of goodwill; changes in the fair value of contingent consideration; gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and other infrequent or unusual items. Beginning in 2024, for our non-GAAP reporting, we are utilizing a long-term projected non-GAAP effective tax rate of 28%, which includes the tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments and reflects currently available information as well as other factors and assumptions. While we expect to use this normalized non-GAAP effective tax rate through 2024, this long-term non-GAAP effective tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or changes to our strategy or business operations. Our GAAP effective tax can vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, discrete items which are recorded in the period they occur, the tax effects of certain items of income or expense, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or changes to our strategy or business operations. We are unable to predict the timing and amounts of these items, which could significantly impact our GAAP effective tax rate, and therefore we are unable to reconcile our forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate measure to our GAAP effective tax rate. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, as they exclude important information about SGH\u2019s financial results, as noted above. The presentation of these adjusted amounts varies from amounts presented in accordance with GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to amounts reported by other companies. In addition, adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used for, operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be used as a measure of liquidity. Investors are encouraged to review the \u201cReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\u201d tables below.

        "Extracted Text": "KEY POINTS Smart Global badly missed expectations with its latest quarter's results and its outlook. Shares of Smart Global Holdings (SGH 4.46%) closed the trading session Friday down by 44.4% after the company announced disappointing quarterly results and weak forward guidance. For its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Aug. 25, net sales from continuing operations declined by 12.6% year over year to $316.7 million, translating to adjusted (non-GAAP) net earnings of $0.35 per share. Analysts, on average, had been modeling for earnings of $0.46 per share on revenue of $375 million. CEO Mark Adams noted the company is contending with \"what remains a challenging global economic environment,\" adding that its \"team has made significant progress in our transformational journey toward becoming an enterprise solutions company focused on higher quality revenue and improving gross margins.\" To that end, in mid-June, Smart Global entered into an agreement to sell an 81% interest in its Smart Brazil operations, which are now classified as discontinued operations in the company's financial statements. That sale should close some time between late calendar 2023 and early 2024. In the meantime, for the first quarter of its fiscal 2024, Smart Global expects revenue of $250 million to $300 million, with adjusted earnings ranging from breakeven to $0.15 per share. Here again -- the impact of discontinued operations notwithstanding -- both ranges were far below Wall Street's consensus estimates for fiscal first-quarter earnings of $0.40 per share on revenue closer to $383 million. In the end, this was a painful quarter that fell far short of expectations, compounded by losses related to the divestiture of Smart Global's Brazil operations. That might well put the company in a better financial position, but investors obviously aren't pleased with the headwinds facing the remaining business in today's tough macro environment. The stock price reacted accordingly.

We had record quarterly revenue of 470 million, record non-GAAP gross margins of 27%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.16 then, which was at the upper end of our guidance range, with excellent performance across all of our businesses. Common to each of our businesses, Intelligent Platform Solutions, Memory Solutions, and LED Solutions, is the focus on delivering operational excellence that leverages our SGH operating system. SGH is an engineering-driven set of businesses that delivers advanced technology solutions at the system or subsystem level, addressing the unique or specialty requirements of our customers, helping them compete in the markets they serve. I continue to be extremely proud of our team's execution, especially in light of the unprecedented challenges stemming from operating during the COVID pandemic era amid microelectronics supply chain shortages. I'm excited to share some of the successes from each of our three businesses. Starting with the Intelligent Platform Solutions group, or IPS, which turned in another record quarter with revenue of approximately $119 million, 80% higher than the same quarter of last year and more than 20% higher compared to the prior quarter, our Q4 '21. Expanding customer engagements in ultra-scale, government, and the oil and gas end markets contributed to the strength in sales in Q1. Our managed services growth initiative is progressing well with revenues almost doubling in Q1 fiscal '22 as compared to Q1 fiscal '21. Software and services for IPS overall represented approximately 17% of total IPS Q1 fiscal '22 revenue. What I believe is still underappreciated in the world of high-performance computing is the complexity of integrating a myriad of technology components and subsystems, including GPUs and CPUs, advanced memory solutions, enterprise storage, networking systems, cooling systems, along with software, and optimizing them for specific workloads within the data center. There are a few companies capable of both designing and delivering complete hardware infrastructure and software-based solutions, while offering best-in-class support services to the extent we do at Penguin. With AI and machine learning still in their infancy, we are well-positioned to capitalize on this growing trend. Our 20 years of experience in HPC enables us to design and manufacture best-in-class systems, customized for our customers' workloads, implement the systems, optimize the systems for commercial, scalable performance and maintain the systems for maximum availability. Another strategic priority for our business is enhancing capabilities to service our customers via the cloud. At Supercomputing '21, which took place in this past November, Penguin Computing announced the launch of its GovPOD HPC AI cloud solution, an on-demand, high-performance, secure environment that supports AI, traditional HPC, and containerized workflows. We continue to invest in offerings such as the GovPOD HPC AI cloud solution to address our customers' future needs for an as-a-service offering in a secure environment. The success of our unique, workload-centric approach to solving our customers' HPC and AI challenges is garnering increasing industry recognition. In November, Hyperion Research declared that Penguin Computing was the fastest-growing major HPC solution provider of 2021. This is a testament to our team and the trust our customers have placed with us to help them maximize their compute, network, and storage infrastructure to solve complex problems. Now, turning to LED Solutions group, which had another strong quarter of operating performance. Revenues were 112 million in Q1, which is in line with our expectations and up substantially when compared with Q1 fiscal 2021 when this business was still part of Cree Wolfspeed. Revenue growth was driven by customer wins with our high-brightness products into the video, architectural, and landscape specialty lighting markets. We continue to execute on our manufacturing transformation plan. The transition from silicon carbide to sapphire wafers and from a captive manufacturing model to an outsourced capital-light model strengthens our cost competitiveness in the markets we serve. On the product front, the team is focused on delivering innovative application-optimized LEDs, enabling a variety of lighting designs while achieving the best overall system value. Recent highlights of these efforts include: the launch of three new products in our extreme high-power product line, which deliver improved brightness and efficiency; securing new design wins of our CV94D products, which are optimized for the video display markets such as billboard and traffic signs; and expanding our road map with exciting new products that leverage our cutting-edge packaging technology, addressing both the high-power and custom mid-power lighting spaces. These products target high-valued color-mixing applications which will enable Cree LED to deliver the next generation of premier lighting products for architectural, horticultural, medical, and stage lighting applications. We believe that Cree's focus on innovation, industry-leading intellectual property, and application level differentiation will result in improved traction in our targeted market segments. In our Memory Solutions group, operating under the SMART Modular brand name, revenues grew by 6% to 239 million in fiscal Q1 of 2022 versus the same quarter a year ago. And on an apples-to-apples basis, revenues were actually up approximately 20% from the year-ago quarter and adjusted for the impact of customer revenue recognition that we reclassified beginning in our third quarter of fiscal 2021. Driving this strong year-over-year performance has been an increased sale of our core specialty solutions, such as DDR3, DDR4, and flash products to our Tier 1 networking and telecom customers. We are also beginning to see the benefits of the investments we've made in our memory product roadmap, targeting new verticals such as data center and cloud. One example is our OpenCAPI DDIMM products, which are now ramping at a leading data center customer. And on the SSD front, we remain on plan and expect to ramp production in Brazil during Q4 of the fiscal year. The team has also made great progress on developing solutions targeted for the upcoming DDR5 transition. We are actively engaged with several Tier 1 customers on next-generation NVDIMMs and are in design of the CXL DDR5 memory module for system validation to address the industry's need for additional memory in both data center and cloud applications. We are developing the industry's first DDR5 very low profile, or VLP, RDIMM for industrial, security, and networking applications. These VLP modules for new DDR5 1U play computing and storage applications help customers maximize density and minimize system board space. We're excited about the opportunities ahead of us in our memory business and feel uniquely positioned to serve the needs of our expanding customer base. Our 30-plus years of design engineering and manufacturing know-how, providing custom solutions that incorporate hardware, firmware, and software, as well as our expertise in controller-based memory products, position us for success, particularly as memory has taken on a much more integral role in the overall compute ecosystem. In the past, I've discussed our goal of becoming a more independently governed public company. And in mid-December, we announced that as of our upcoming annual shareholder meeting on February 11th, our board will be entirely independent, with the exception of myself, and more diversified with one-third of the board comprised of female directors. I also wanted to note, the board has approved a 2-for-1 share split. We anticipate this being completed in our current quarter. This is intended to further improve our liquidity and to broaden our shareholder base. Ken will provide more detail in his commentary. We are off to a strong start in fiscal 2022 and remain focused on operational excellence across all of our businesses. We will continue to drive growth and diversification, strive to expand margins, and efficiently run the company to deliver improved financial performance and increase value for our shareholders. At this time, I'll hand it over to Ken for a more detailed review of the financials and our guidance for next quarter. Ken? Ken Rizvi -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Mark. The first quarter of 2022 is the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for SGH and demonstrates how our strategy is continuing to play out with strong performance across all three of our businesses. A year ago, close to 80% of our net sales came from Memory Solutions and nearly 90% of our operating income. Today, in the first quarter of 2022, Memory Solutions represents approximately 50% of our overall net sales and operating income. We see tremendous opportunities ahead for SGH in 2022 and beyond to deliver advanced technology solutions for our customers across all three of our businesses. Let me turn to our fiscal first quarter 2022 results. I will focus my remarks on our non-GAAP results which are reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release tables. We reported another strong quarter in fiscal Q1. Net sales for the first quarter were $470 million, another record for the company, and an increase of 61% on a year-over-year basis from the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and up slightly from Q4. In addition, non-GAAP gross margin came in at a record 27%. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.16 for the first quarter, both at the higher end of our guidance ranges. On a year-over-year basis, SGH revenue growth of 61% was helped by the incorporation of Cree LED into SGH. Excluding Cree LED, our revenues grew approximately 23% on a year-over-year basis, mainly driven by IPS which grew 80% and Memory Solutions which grew 6%. For the first quarter, IPS had revenues of approximately $119 million, another record for that business. As we have discussed in our previous earnings call, the IPS business will continue to have quarter-to-quarter variability in revenue and gross margins based on the timing of hardware, software, and managed services in any given quarter. Our LED Solutions group had revenues of $112 million in the first quarter. This was in line with our commentary last quarter. As we head into the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we anticipate revenues for LED Solutions to come down sequentially, primarily due to seasonality in the second fiscal quarter. We continue to migrate toward a fab-lite structure, enabling a more flexible operational model to better manage fluctuations of demand and supply. Our Memory Solutions group had revenues of $239 million in the first quarter. Revenue grew year-over-year from growth in both our Specialty Memory and Brazil business and overall by approximately 20% when adjusted for the impact of the customer revenue reclassification from a gross to net basis that we discussed a few quarters ago. Non-GAAP gross margin for SGH in the first quarter was a record 27%, up from 26.4% in the prior quarter and up from 18.6% in the first fiscal quarter of 2021. Gross margins for SGH were helped by stronger margin performance from our Memory Solutions group, and gross margins from both LED Solutions group and IPS also remained relatively strong. Our IPS segment continued to benefit from higher-margin managed services and software mix in the first quarter. As we have discussed in the past, our IPS business will have variability in its gross margin profile quarter-to-quarter based on the mix of hardware, managed services, and software. Operating expenses for the first quarter were approximately $57.9 million, up from $30.4 million in the first quarter of 2021. Operating expenses were up primarily due to the inclusion of LED Solutions and continued investments in our Memory Solutions and IPS businesses. In addition, operating expenses benefited in the first fiscal quarter of 2022 from approximately $5.9 million in financial credits in Brazil. This helped offset our Brazil R&D spending which is required to realize this credit. As we have previously indicated, the law enabling this credit is currently set to expire in January of 2022. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was $2.16 per share, equal to the record $2.16 achieved in the prior quarter and up 177% from $0.78 per share in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2022 was $76.7 million or 16.3% of sales compared to $29.5 million or 10.1% of sales in the first quarter of 2021. Our breakdown of net sales by end markets for the first fiscal quarter of 2022 was as follows: mobile and PCs was 21%; network and telecom was 10%; servers and storage was 12%; AI, data analytics, and machine learning was 15%; advanced lighting was 24%; and industrial, defense, and other was 18%. Now, turning to working capital. Our net accounts receivable totaled $344 million compared with $313 million last quarter. Days sales outstanding came in at 39 days, flat with the last quarter on a days basis. Inventory totaled $318 million at the end of the first quarter, down from $364 million at the end of the prior quarter. This reduction was driven by lower inventory for Memory Solutions and IPS. Inventory turns were 8.6 times in the first quarter versus 6.8 times in the prior quarter. And consistent with past practice, accounts receivable, days outstanding, and inventory turnover are calculated on a gross sales and cost of goods sold basis which were $806 million and $684 million, respectively, for the first quarter. As a reminder, the difference between gross revenue and net sales is related to our supply chain services business which is accounted for on an agent basis, meaning that we only recognize the net profit on a supply chain services transaction as net sales. Cash and equivalents totaled $233 million at the end of the first quarter compared with $223 million in the prior quarter. First quarter cash flow from operations totaled $15.1 million compared with $48 million in the prior quarter. During the quarter, given the timing of our November quarter end, as well as the constraints in the overall global electronic supply chain, more of our capital was tied up in working capital to help ensure we continue to meet the needs of our customers. For those of you tracking capex and depreciation, capex was $12.8 million for the first quarter and depreciation was $9.5 million. Before turning to our guidance, I wanted to highlight that the company is announcing a 2-for-1 share split in the form of a share dividend of one ordinary share per one outstanding ordinary share. The share split is a significant milestone for the company and intended to improve our liquidity and broaden our shareholder base. The additional shares are expected to be distributed on February 1, 2022, to shareholders of record as of January 25, 2022. The dividend will double the number of outstanding ordinary shares. Note that ordinary shares and per share data in this call and in our earnings release have not been adjusted for the impact of the share split. Also, our guidance does not incorporate the impact from the share split. Now, turning to our fiscal second quarter 2022 guidance. We expect that net sales for the second quarter of 2022 will range from approximately $415 million to $455 million, lower than the first quarter, primarily due to seasonality from our LED business, as well as the expected quarter-to-quarter variability of our IPS business. Our GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2022 is expected to be between 23% and 25%. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2022 is expected to be approximately 24% to 26%, driven primarily by lower overall sequential sales and lower mix from sales in our LED and IPS businesses. Our non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $55 million to $62 million in the second quarter of 2022. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $0.70, plus or minus $0.15. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding share-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization expense, convertible debt discount, and other adjustments, we expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share will be approximately $1.45, plus or minus $0.15. Again, our second quarter EPS guidance does not include the impact from our share split announcement which is expected to be effective at the beginning of February. Cash capital expenditures for the second fiscal quarter are expected to be in the range of $12 million to $15 million. Our GAAP diluted share count for the second quarter of fiscal '22 is expected to be approximately 29 million shares based on our current stock price. Our non-GAAP diluted share count for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 is expected to be approximately 28 million shares and it includes the benefit of our convertible note, capped call. Our share count guidance does not incorporate the share split, which will be effective from the beginning of February. Our forecast for the second fiscal quarter is based on the current environment, which contemplates the constraints in the global supply chain. Please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section and the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures tables in our earnings release for further details. With that, let me turn the call back to Mark for some concluding comments before we open the call to questions. Mark? Mark Adams -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Ken. And thanks to all of you for your support. We look forward to meeting with you in the coming months, virtually or in person, and updating you as we continue to execute on our growth and diversification strategy. We appreciate all of you for joining today's call. Operator, please open the lines for Q&A. Operator [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Your line is now open. Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. And congrats on the nice results. My first question was just about the performance during the quarter. It looked like the IPS business, you know, far exceeds your expectations. I know you said it was up -- I think it was up greater than 20%. You had previously talked in some calls about some U.S. government awards totaling almost $70 million. Is the timing of those awards the difference there? Or was there some traction with new customers that kind of led to the upside? Any color there would be helpful. Mark Adams -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. The award that you're referring to, close to -- it was actually 68 million, Tom, is more likely a second half Q3, Q4 timing. So, that's not contemplated in our results today. Today was a little bit of increase in some of the business opportunities at our existing customers, as well as some new development accounts that have registered some revenue opportunities for us. Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst Helpful. And then you mentioned in the preamble that your efforts for the SSD business are going to ramp in Q4 during the fiscal year. Could you just give us some perspective on what you think the size of that opportunity is? You know, how big can that be for you guys? Obviously, it's a little bit later this year, so a little further out. But just over time, you know, what could that look like for your business? Mark Adams -- Chief Executive Officer Well, OK, just roughly -- and Ken can hold me to this, the Brazil business is somewhere in the $450 million, $475 million range from a scale perspective on a, you know, kind of a backwards-looking, you know, kind of last 12 months pace. And if you look at that, we think the SSD business is something that could ramp up in the short term over the next -- you know, starting from Q4 out on a 12-month basis, roughly in the $40 million, $45 million range. And we expect to hit a run rate, you know, of a quarterly run rate of roughly 10 million by Q4. Now, let me qualify also that, you know, this is an area that we have seen some constraints on the electronic supply chain shortage. Some of the components there are ones that could be in our way of getting there. But we feel pretty good about it today as we sit here in Q1. And overall, we like our position relative to the market and our manufacturing of SSDs in country to be at the pace, I said, roughly, again, think about Q4 target roughly of $10 million and a run rate business of about $40 million, $45 million. Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst Great, that's helpful. Congrats on the nice results guys. Mark Adams -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Tom. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Stifel. Your line is now open. Brian Chin -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Hi there. Happy New Year to everyone, and thanks for allowing us to ask a few questions. Maybe my first question, actually -- Mark Adams -- Chief Executive Officer [Inaudible]. Brian Chin -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Thanks. My first question is about the financial credits in Brazil tied to R&D. And so -- I guess based on our understanding, there's been some progress there toward a possible extension of the program that underlies those credits that you benefit from. And so going forward, there may not be such an increase in your opex as you've talked to here in the past. So, I'm curious, do you share that view that there's a high probability of an extension? And two, what would your EPS guide for the February quarter be assuming that that program is extended? Mark Adams -- Chief Executive Officer Let me take the front half of that, and I'll ask Ken maybe to quantify any hypothetical changes that could be pending. As you know, we, Ken and I, both have articulated what the current law says, and that's the expiration of these tax credits in January of '22. Needless to say, in the background, we've been working with the government and, as the largest memory manufacturer in country, have a pretty good presence. As a matter of fact, the president of our Brazil business is the head of what -- their semiconductor association in Brazil. And so, we've been lobbying pretty hard. And I think the government has recently contemplated, you know, the impact of things like the supply constraints in the industry, and they understand the value. And so, we think there is a probability that they will extend these tax credits in some way, shape, or form, albeit it has not been done at the timing of our call today. So, we think there's been a lot of progress, especially over the last 30 days. We're very much part of the lobbying to the government for these tax credits to be extended. And we'll certainly keep you posted.Ken, maybe you can just kind of give us a sense on what that might look like in Q2. Ken Rizvi -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So, Brian, in Q2, there isn't an impact for us even if that law gets extended. And it's just based on the timing of our quarter end for the Brazil business. It's actually one month ahead of our quarter end for our other businesses that's outlined in our Q. Brian Chin -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst OK. Ken Rizvi -- Chief Financial Officer So, there is no impact here in Q2. If it does get extended in Q3, Q4, it's still a bit TBD depending on what the specific law would look like. So, for now, I think what we've outlined to the analysts and to the Street on our last call, based on the current law, I would just keep it as is in terms of that credit going away as we look at Q3 and Q4. If things change, obviously, we can have an update after that law changes. Brian Chin -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst OK. All right, fair enough. Appreciate the color. I guess we'll stay tuned on that probably in the near term. Maybe kind of more broadly, and I'll focus just a little bit on the IPS business specifically, but clearly, there are some challenges out there. You alluded to them in terms of labor and hardware availability and cost. And I guess, specifically, again, in the IPS business, can you give us an idea and quantify what those headwinds of growth and our operating margin expansion might be that you're facing right now or over the duration of the fiscal year? Because you're playing good results. But obviously, this is something that you're having to work through in your inventory. It obviously went down a lot on higher revenue, but also, maybe you even want that to be a little bit higher in this environment. Mark Adams -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. I think it also is -- specific to the inventory, you should go back and say, \"What was the right level, kind of, pre all this?\" Because as we mentioned on our last call, from an inventory perspective, we had a holdover on a shipment that went out earlier in Q1. So, I wouldn't read too much into the inventory movement per se. I think we're acknowledging that, you know, the supply chain constraints are real. Having said that, you know, it's a record quarter. And this is a business, I think, as I mentioned before, that grew substantially in Q -- in '21. And we're pretty bullish on '22. So, I don't look at it like a headwind per se. I think that the complexity of the systems, just the depth of the technology that we integrate into these finished goods systems and the overlying software and services, all of that has to come together with the timing of deliveries. And we're just working with the constraints that everybody else is under. I mean NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, a number of different suppliers are tight on lead times, and we're working on that. Having said that, it really hasn't had a massive impact on our business. And, you know, we expect a, you know, strong growth here in IPS and I think get out of the gates with a record quarter here. So, we're just cautious to the sense that the world is operating in these certain times of constraints. And we just want to call that out. Brian Chin -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst OK, fair enough. I appreciate all the color. Thanks so much. Mark Adams -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Ken Rizvi -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Brian. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Raji Gill with Needham and Company. Your line is now open. Raji Gill -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Yes, thank you. And I echo my congratulations on really good results and momentum. Just on the IPS segment, the lumpiness in that, obviously, it was a very strong quarter in November. You're looking for it to be down in February. Is there a way to think about the seasonality on a quarter-by-quarter basis at least on the topline. And with respect to the gross margin for IPS, you mentioned 17% of our revenue is coming from services. That also is very volatile. Is there a goal to increase the percentage of IPS that come from services? And if so, you know, how do you intend to do that? And what are the steps? Mark Adams -- Chief Executive Officer Let me start with the back part of that question. I'll let Ken talk to some of the seasonality and how you might want to model that or think about that. But on the service side, I think we've targeted, over the next three years, we'd like to get this business somewhere in the neighborhood of 25%, plus or minus. Now, mind you, when a business is growing last year over 30% and we consider this to be a -- still a very strong growth business for us in the '22 and beyond, you know, your services are doing well just to keep up with the impressive revenue growth that we see at the topline. But the -- part of what we're doing, as we think about the growth opportunities, is being a little bit selective in the engagements we're participating in. This can be a very low gross margin business if it's only hardware. And those are not the type of opportunities we want to be in. As I talked about in my commentary, we get a lot of value creation with our customers from the design side of the business upfront and the system design to optimize around the workloads of each of our customers specific to their needs. And so it starts with that, the actual integration services, deployment services, and post-sale maintenance, break-fix services. These are all part of the elements that we're emphasizing in our proposals upfront. And each customer is a little bit different, so it's hard for us to give you an exact kind of precise measurement on how each customer will engage with us. But whether, you know, we bid upfront on certain transactions is really driven by the full engagement model that we have with these customers. We're not going to be a hardware-only shop. Now -- also, before I hand it to Ken on this, I'll just mention to you that this lumpiness and mix issue shows up because in certain quarters, we're installing these systems. And some of the larger deployments can dominate a specific quarter hardware-wise or services-wise, depending on which quarter. As we've mentioned on our Q4 call, we had the benefit of a number of services that helped our mix and our gross margin as they did in Q1. And so we will do our best to guide to that. But there will be quarters that are very service-rich and there will be quarters that -- where the hardware deployment is the beginning of a new installation, and services will follow on in due quarters. So, Ken, maybe if it would be OK, if you could just talk a little bit about the quarter-by-quarter overall trend line of business. Ken Rizvi -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So, Raji, yeah, thanks for the question. As we look at this business, we've tried to highlight that there is variability quarter-to-quarter. And the business overall, though, has grown dramatically. We talked about 80% type of growth year over year. And even as we look at the pipeline into the second half of the year, that still remains very strong. So while we do expect a little bit of a downtick in sales Q1 to Q2 based on the variability, our expectations are that as we head into the back half of the year, we should see some growth or continued growth for this business in the back half of the fiscal year. Now, we're not going to provide any specifics. But I would say the pipeline does look good as we head into Q3 and Q4 for the back half of 2022. Raji Gill -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Very good. And for my follow-up, on the LED business, in the presentation, you mentioned the shift over to the sapphire and fab-lite models can be completed within this calendar '22. Once that happens, what's the -- kind of the normalized LED gross margins on a go-forward basis? Are there other levers that you could pull to drive the LED margins above and beyond that? Or is that kind of the level you want to maintain that business at once you achieve, you know, the manufacturing transition? Mark Adams -- Chief Executive Officer I think -- again, Ken will jump in on the numbers side. Let me just -- philosophically speaking, we've got some -- you know, we've got a little room to go on the transition itself. And then some of this has to do with how we design future products for new customer environments and which products get used as the base platform. So, we think that this cost competitiveness we have achieved will not only benefit us as we finish out the transition but will allow us to use some of this new technology and newer market opportunities. Ken, maybe you can follow on the back half. Ken Rizvi -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Yeah. And then in terms of the margin profile, I mean, one of the things that we've done here is focused on the three segments in aggregate SGH margin which we've outlined. But for this business, you know, I would expect that the margin profile is in that low to mid-30% range over time, but we won't give specifics on any given quarter. Raji Gill -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Thank you. That's helpful. And then just one more question on the margin and then I'll step back. In the November quarter, the overall margins were 27%. You mentioned that a lot of that was driven by stronger margins from Memory. I'm wondering if you could describe what's going on in Memory. That's independent, obviously, of the LED manufacturing transition and it's independent of the IPS, you know, given the percentage of the services. But what are the steps you've taken to improve the margins in Specialty Memory and kind of Brazil Memory? Thank you. Mark Adams -- Chief Executive Officer Well, I think similar to how we're treating IPS, and really all of our businesses, LED has done a great job on this as well, is really looking at business opportunities where we can, you know, kind of create some additional value and drive a better mix. We saw better end market opportunities in Memory in the Specialty. And then, also, I would say, our mix toward Flash was a little stronger in Q1 than it was in prior quarters. And so our custom Flash business is one that's a little bit more attractive, given the configuration of the controller and products overall from a solution standpoint. And it's a little bit more, yeah, specialty in nature, differentiated. And so, that mix can help. And so, when you combine kind of the market opportunities we're going after in terms of the end markets and allocating kind of limited resources in terms of inventory to the right app to mark products, all in all, I think it's a mix issue that you're identifying. And really, the end market segments that we're prioritizing in terms of development away from kind of the commodity side of the business, whether it be standard products to more differentiated specialty products. Raji Gill -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Got it. Congratulations again. Mark Adams -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sidney Ho -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Thanks, and thanks for taking my questions. So, I have a couple of questions on the Memory Solutions business. In your prepared remarks, you talked about ramping up this OpenCAPI DDIMM at a leading customer. Is that a new opportunity for you? Or does it replace an existing product that you already offered? And maybe can you help us understand how big this opportunity could be. Mark Adams -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. It's a really good example to the question that Raji was asking. Basically, this is a new customer socket opportunity. This is not a replacement. And the DDIMM application that we've described is one that we stepped in, we provided a value-add in terms of engineering and testing reliability, as well as kind of engineering design. And it started out to be in low single digits millions of dollars in the prior quarter. And we think that this could grow in fiscal year '22 in the range of 10% to 15% of the Specialty Memory business, so somewhere in the $40 million to $50 million range. And that type of engagement, Sidney, is one that the company hasn't really done super well on the custom side in the newer application environments of late. Jack and the team have done a great job this year, out cultivating new opportunities. And we're starting to see the benefit of some of these in data center, cloud, and even the high-performance compute. Sidney Ho -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst That's helpful. Thanks. My next question is last quarter, you talked about part of the increase in your inventory was driven by your supply chain business where you are not the risk-taker. I assume they may be worried about component shortages or whatnot. Has your -- has there been any changes in your conversations with those customers in terms of their procurement strategy? Ken Rizvi -- Chief Financial Officer So, I will -- Sidney, on that front, I would say that the supply chain is still really tight. I think it's no different than probably what you're hearing from other folks that are supplying to the global electronic industry. And so it's tight on various components and our customers are doing it to us, and we're doing it to our suppliers. And so, we're just navigating through that, then you'll see some ebbs and flows as we move through this year. I think, like all companies, our -- we believe our supply chain team is doing a great job in terms of ensuring that we can get the components we need to service our customers. And so, we're navigating it like everybody else, but it's a tight supply chain overall. Sidney Ho -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst OK. Maybe one last one for me, if I may. Appreciate you guys start providing operating margin by business segment in your last annual report with data going back for a few years. Can you talk about how we should think about operating margin targets by segment going forward? I know in the past, you talked about the gross margin by segment but just trying to figure out now that the new disclosure is operating margins. So, just trying to think about how to think about it going forward. Ken Rizvi -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. We haven't outlined specific targets by each of the business segments. I think in aggregate, we've talked about, you know, just a while ago at least, achieving in this kind of 12%, 13%, 14%, 15% EBIT target, which is where we're at today. So, I think over the course of the next 12 months or so, we can outline some higher targets. But in aggregate, we feel like the business is operating very well with the current EBITDA -- or EBIT, sorry, levels that we've been able to achieve. I think, you know, one of the things that we've outlined on the prepared remarks and via Q&A is that there will be variability, specifically as it relates to the IPS business and the margin profile quarter to quarter. You've seen that, as we've migrated from Q1 and toward our guide in Q2, that there is some variability in the overall gross margins which then impact the operating margins. But overall, you know, business is tremendously healthy if you look at where we are today versus just 12 months ago in terms of both the gross margin profile and the operating margin profile of the business. We're just so different today as a company than 12 months ago. Sidney Ho -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Great. Thank you very much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Rosenblatt. Your line is now open. Kevin Cassidy -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst Thank you and congratulations also on the great results. The GovPOD or the Penguin-On-Demand is an interesting product line, to me anyway. And can you give us a little more description of what that is and how many agencies you're addressing? And would there be a commercial version of this, something besides just the public sector or private sector? Mark Adams -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. Good question. Thanks, Kevin. Yes, GovPOD for us is really an extension of our partnerships that we have with the government and our clients in the government. Because really what's happening is we're seeing in high-performance compute, I think I mentioned this on prior calls is that we don't think this is kind of binary. We think this is a hybrid model that's evolving. And this extension of our on-premise relationship with these clients is that they want to utilize and benefit from the economics and just the flexibility of operating in an as-a-service model for certain applications. And so, this extension really is for our existing customers and potentially new customers to use this platform, sometimes early on in the development of testing out applications and sometimes because these applications are not ones that are frequently used or the overhead doesn't warrant a full on-prem system. So, from that perspective, it works in the government, yes, and it works -- we also have a platform called Penguin-On-Demand, just POD, P-O-D. And that is one that we've got that's up and running today. Again, very small in terms of the revenue contribution, I want to say a couple of million dollars a quarter in the business. And -- but it's something that we're trying to cultivate more and more as our clients want to have the flexibility for future development, as well as new customers that we can target that just, quite frankly, aren't going to go out and make an investment in their own data center implementation of high-performance compute AI. So, it is an opportunity for us. It's early going, and we're investing in it. And so, as you look at Penguin on a go-forward basis, you'll hear more about that in our efforts to drive a hybrid model, both on-prem and in the cloud. Kevin Cassidy -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks for that explanation. And what do you see as the competitive landscape for this? Are you seeing your competitors coming in with similar products? Or are you ahead of the competition? Mark Adams -- Chief Executive Officer Well, I think there's kind of two parts of that question. One is our current on-prem customers are looking at elements of the strategy, and they're investing. And then there's obviously the cloud service providers themselves who are developing a high-performance compute approach. Now, the one that -- the latter of the cloud service providers, the top three or four of those parties, are potential partners of ours. Actually, they were in discussions with those type of providers where we can provide design and system utilization advisory capabilities to our customers in a cloud environment. And so, at the end of the day, this vertical that we operate in, we're kind of a trusted advisor. And I think you'll see elements of our own on-demand as a service, as well as potentially utilizing some of these cloud providers as a back end to our offerings. So, it's pretty good flexibility that we're developing here relative to customer engagements while we strike this at the core. Kevin Cassidy -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Mark Adams -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Mark Adams, I turn the call back over to you. Mark Adams -- Chief Executive Officer Well, again, I'd like to thank everyone for joining our call today. The team did a great job in Q1 with record revenue, non-GAAP record gross margins of 27% and an EPS of $2.16, tying the record we just set in Q4 of '21. We feel like we have a lot of momentum and look forward to reporting on our future growth and success. With that, the call will end. Thank you.

I'd like to begin by saying I'm very pleased to be here. My first full quarter as CEO at SMART. As we continue an exciting phase of growth and also continue to broaden our offerings and customer base. I'm very honored to take this position from Iain MacKenzie, who served as SMART's CEO for the past 13 years. Under his leadership, SMART has grown into a great leader and a valued partner to our OEM customers worldwide. With the company's tremendous success to date, we now have the opportunity to continue building on this position and to pursue many exciting new opportunities. I am looking forward to continuing to work closely with Iain as he remains on the Board of Directors at SMART. Turning to the business. The third fiscal quarter which we concluded late in May, marked a turning point in terms of our longer-term strategic direction. Meanwhile, while we made these strategic moves, we continue to execute well by leveraging our business model and unique competitive positioning across all of our different business units. We reported another strong quarter with net sales of $335 million or about 62% higher than the year before. Non-GAAP operating income of $53.8 million was 117% higher than a year ago. And non-GAAP diluted EPS came in at $1.84 per share or roughly 2x over the year-ago period. Our results continue to be driven by both our Specialty Memory business and our growing business in Brazil. I'll cover each of these areas and also comment on our recently announced acquisition of Penguin Computing, which puts us in a new business, before turning the call over to Jack for a more detailed review of the financials and our guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter. Moving to our Specialty Memory business. We had another very solid quarter, with net sales in excess of $100 million for the third consecutive quarter. Our extensive knowledge of the memory markets and our deep customer relationships, provide us the visibility to drive sustained and predictable growth in this area. Underpinning this outlook are several factors. We continue to be the key supplier to our major OEM customers that require application-specific DOM and flash-based memory product and we're a trusted partner and supplier to these customers for a whole range of different specialized solutions. Additionally, as we have mentioned in past quarters, newer nonvolatile NVDIMM solutions utilizing all-flash arrays within servers and storage equipment is driving increased demand for both our Flash and DRAM solutions. In the backdrop of the health of the overall memory market, we continue to see a constructive supply/demand dynamic with multiple demand drivers, along with orderly supply expansion. In particular, relevant to us, prices of DRAM devices, such as DDR3, that are a major part of our DRAM product mix, have been very steady. Also, while many of the new designs we have utilize 3D NAND, our shipping mix today for NAND Flash continues to be based on the stable market for SLC and MLC technologies. Moving now to our recent acquisition of Penguin Computing. Through this acquisition, we're greatly increasing both the markets and the technologies that we participate in and serve and also, the types of customers we reach via Penguin's leading position in specialty compute and storage solutions. These products and services target applications in artificial intelligence, machine learning and high-performance computing using state-of-the-art open technologies and advanced architectures. We are very excited to have Penguin as the cornerstone of our new business unit, which we call the SMART Specialty Compute & Storage Solutions or SCSS business, which will serve as a broad platform for us to further build on by leveraging our shared infrastructure and proven ability to integrate and scale businesses. Finally, referring to our business in Brazil. We had another extremely strong quarter, which came on top of the exceptionally strong fiscal second quarter. In our third fiscal quarter that we concluded, we had stronger-than-expected results, thanks in part to pull-ins as our customers prepare for the production slowdown during the World Cup event by building a little early. Building on our success in the memory markets in Brazil, we have recently partnered to create a new business unit in Brazil focused on batteries for smartphones. We've been investing in this in terms of the manufacturing lines and processes as well as the staffing that is required for the business and we expect first shipments to begin in our fiscal 2019. Longer term, we continue to target other areas in Brazil, including communications devices such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth modules, and other products to support the Internet of things or IOT markets. With that, I'll now hand you over to Jack to discuss the financials in more detail. Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer Thank you, Ajay. As Ajay mentioned, top-line results were driven by both our Specialty Memory and our Brazil businesses, supported by continued healthy dynamics in the global memory market. Overall gross revenue for the third fiscal quarter was $593.6 million, our net sales were $335.5 million. As a reminder, the difference between gross revenue and net sales is related to our supply chain services business, which is accounted for an agency basis, meaning that we only recognize as net sales the net profit on the supply chain services transactions. Net sales increased by 7% over the previous quarter, and by 62% over the year-ago quarter. Our breakdown of net sales with end market for the third fiscal quarter was as follows, mobile and PCs 61%; network and telecom, 17%; servers and storage, 14%; industrial, aerospace, defense and other, 8%. As Ajay mentioned earlier, we have launched a new business in Brazil to focus on battery assembly for smartphones. We expect to invest approximately $2 million to $3 million in start-up cost along with R&D in the fourth fiscal quarter to support this new initiative and expect this to contribute to revenue on our Q1 of FY '19. With this investment, we are leveraging our 15-year proven track record of establishing and growing businesses in Brazil. Similar to our mobile memory and DRAM initiatives, we have secured a partnership with a leader in the space, Samsung SDI. We are utilizing our in-country manufacturing expertise, along with the advantages for our customers of having local manufacturing. Now moving to the rest of the income statement. Non-GAAP gross profit for the third quarter was $78.5 million, up 7% as compared with last quarter's $73.2 million while non-GAAP operating expenses of $24.7 million remained unchanged from last quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the third fiscal quarter was $43 million or $1.84 per diluted share, compared to $37.7 million or $1.64 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $14.6 million or $0.92 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Beginning this quarter and continued forward, we've excluded from our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share the effect of foreign exchange gains or losses. Adjusted EBITDA was $51.5 million in the third fiscal quarter, compared to $56.2 million in the prior quarter and $29.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Included in the third-quarter GAAP fiscal 2018 results are FX related losses that contributed approximately $6.9 million, compared to last quarter, when we had FX-related gains of $2.4 million and FX-related loss of $1 million in the year-ago quarter. Turning to working capital. Our net accounts receivables increased to $262.1 million from $223.5 million last quarter as our days sales outstanding increased to 40.2 days for this quarter, compared with 37.5 days last quarter. Inventory decreased slightly to $147.9 million from $148.6 million in the prior quarter, while our inventory turns were 13.9 times compared with last quarter's 12.6 times. Consistent with past practice, accounts receivable days outstanding and inventory turnover are calculated on a gross sales and cost of goods sold basis, which were $593.6 million and $515.5 million, respectively for third fiscal quarter of 2018. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $64.5 million at the end of the third fiscal quarter. Third-quarter cash flow from operations was $28.3 million, compared with $34.7 million in the prior quarter. We had a very strong fiscal Q3, which was made even stronger as we saw some pull-ins from Q4 due to the World Cup. Our mobile customers are sitting down for a couple of weeks in Q4, so they pulled in some of their demand. Our second half revenues will grow over 14% from the first half, with gross profit growing over 17% and our non-GAAP EPS over 23%. This will be a record year for SMART in terms of revenue and profitability. Now let me turn to our guidance. Our guidance includes a recent acquisition of Penguin Computing, which we closed on June 8 that Ajay discussed earlier. We currently estimate that our fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 net sales will be in the range of $360 million to $380 million. Gross margin for the quarter is estimated to be approximately 22% to 23%. GAAP earnings per diluted share is expected to be between $1.41 to $1.50. On non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition expense and intangible amortization expense, we expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $1.62 to $1.71. The guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter does not include any view on foreign exchange gains or losses and includes an income tax revision expected to be in the range of 14% to 16%. We also have not reflected any purchase price adjustments will be needed for the Penguin acquisition as we're in the initial stage of determining the appropriate adjustments. The number of shares used to compute our earnings per diluted share in the fourth fiscal quarter was $23.4 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth fiscal quarter are expected to be in the range of $10 million to $14 million. Please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section and the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP results and the reconciliation of GAAP net income loss to adjusted EBITDA tables on our earnings press release for further details. That concludes my remarks. Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Your line is now open. Kevin Cassidy -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Thank you and congratulations on the good results. But in your guidance, can you break it down for us a little bit of at least what Penguin is in your guidance? How much revenue is included in that? Ajay Shah -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Right now we're not quite prepared to do that. We have been trying to figure out all the different adjustments that are related to the Penguin acquisition. So as Jack said earlier, we have made the best estimations we can but it's hard to give you a lot of detail there right now. Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer We use a very high-level estimates right now, Kevin. But nothing that we want to kind of firm up in detail yet. Kevin Cassidy -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst OK. And maybe if you can -- also the change in reporting of FX as a GAAP only and non-GAAP. Can you say what was in that decision? Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer Sure. I mean, we don't guide the -- we can't guide FX gains or losses. It was never in our guidance, and so we had this -- the non-GAAP EPS, didn't have it in the guidance and we'd have it in the results, and it was just -- it started to cause a confusion with some investors and other people. And we kind of looked at our peers in the space, and our peers don't include it in their non-GAAP calculations, so we just thought it made more sense for the investors to take it out or it would make it easier for them to look at the comparison on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Ajay Shah -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Just to add to that. Sorry, Kevin. If you think about -- you're looking for our operating results and this gives you a very clear view of our operating results. Now, you know, every quarter the exchange rates move and you get a gain or a loss. Actually, our analysis shows that over multiple years, they more or less even out, but in each quarter, they do provide volatility. So we're trying to provide a look which will reduce that volatility. And then, of course, there is some volatility from the currency movement. Kevin Cassidy -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst OK, understood. Yep. And maybe if I can even ask one more just on Brazil. Are you seeing any change in the economic atmosphere or any of these -- the inflation rate picking up? Is that going to affect your operating expenses in Brazil? Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer Kevin, look when I look at the indicators down in Brazil, I mean, inflation still in May, it was only 2.86%, so, I mean, it picked up, I mean, a tad, really, really small, I mean. So they kept their bank rate at 6.5%. So you know, we really aren't seeing any indicators in Brazil slowing down or really changing, right? I mean, the real has been kind of moving -- weakening but the other indicators have stayed strong. I mean, the inflows of Bovespa pace to be the same as it was last year. So there's nothing there that tells us there's any real issues in the country. Kevin Cassidy -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open. Blayne Curtis -- Founding Managing Partner Yes, here's my question. Curious, obviously, it's hard to track seasonality given some of the ramps you had, particularly lately in mobile. I'm just curious if you could comment about the pull-ins, if you can quantify that and maybe what August seasonality is, you know, minus all of these content gains you've had in mobile over the last two years? Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer Yes, we wouldn't say that. Typically, we have a seasonality in this quarter, but what we have seen is that our customers who produce mobile phones are shutting down for a couple of weeks a piece in the month of July, right? So when they shut down, we're going to lose couple of weeks of revenue in this quarter and we -- you know, our sales, we think, picked up last quarter, because people were building ahead in anticipation of the shutdown. Blayne Curtis -- Founding Managing Partner Gotcha. OK. And then I do want to ask you on the battery investment and to the extent that there would be potential that would be included in some of the content framework. And then just -- with that, also, just the step-up in CAPEX, I was just curious what that investment is. Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer Yes. So in the -- I mean, the battery business and cost -- well, in Q4, they're just pure cost, right? So we're going to have about $2 million or $3 million extra cost in the P&L from the battery business. Well, we won't have any revenues until next year on that business. You know, I mean, the $10 million to $14 million is in line with our CAPEX plan for the year, just happens to be little bit back-end loaded. We're still way into our 2%, 4% of revenue as far as our CAPEX guidance. It's just when the CAPEX comes in when we have to pay for it, kind of, put a little bit about more back-end loaded. And then we did have some CAPEX for the batteries business that we're going to spend in Q4 as well. Blayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst OK. Thanks, guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sidney Ho -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. Just following up with the previous question on Penguin. You guys disclosed the Q1 numbers. Can you at least talk about what do you believe it will be up or down versus the calendar Q1 just totally based on seasonality? And can you also talk about whether on a non-GAAP basis, are you expecting that to be margin and/or EPS accretive in the next quarter? Ajay Shah -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Let me try a part of that. From a revenue standpoint, we do expect there revenue. So the comparisons are difficult. Let me explain first that Penguin is operated on the calendar fiscal quarter, and we have operated, as you know, on a fiscal quarter, which would end a year in August. So you're now comparing their previous quarter with having now being restated into our fiscal quarter. So when we reported, we reported their fiscal quarters as opposed to our fiscal quarters. So I know this is a little more difficult to model exactly right now, but this is just the -- we're literally one week and a few days away from that acquisition having closed. And so we're trying to restate everything into our fiscal quarters, because that's what you would all expect us to do. So really at this stage, providing you with a lot of guidance as to exactly what Penguin is expected to be would be a little premature. As we get those numbers a little more firmed up, we will be happy to get it for you. We have tried to be careful in terms of how we looked at the overall revenue numbers result. Sidney Ho -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst OK, that's fair. Maybe switching subject to the battery business again. Can you give us an idea how to think about the size of that market going forward? And are there any local content requirement similar to the memory side of things that you expect that will kind of help you guys? Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer Yes, I mean, that market, of course, has local content regulations around 60% today. And we've pegged that market, I mean, you know, the ASPs are slower than -- we peg the market as probably a couple of hundred million dollar of market in total today. So, you know, hopefully... Ajay Shah -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. I mean, just in the smartphone category, there are 55 million smartphones. And the average selling prices are, what, in the $10 range? $8 to $10? Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer Yes. A lot more ASPs than we see today so... Ajay Shah -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So that gives you around, the overall market being $500 million, $600 million, and we hope to get our unfair share. Sidney Ho -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst OK. If I can squeeze in one more on the Brazil mobile side. ASPs are certainly trending in the right direction. And you talked about $30 ASP is possible by the end of this year. One is, is that still true? And two, are you seeing any signs that the memory modules are getting too expensive as a percentage of building materials and content are not moving as quickly? Any color will be great. Ajay Shah -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, you know, I have never had a conversation with a customer who didn't complain about the price. So I -- [Inaudible]. We are not -- we continue to see applications driving the memory requirement rather than prices because people are using applications that require the memory. But of course, there are different price points for different customers and there continue to be some segments where they're going to look for less memory and other segments. But overall, we're not seeing those segments change so far. I mean, with the -- the only thing we kind of worry about and keep an eye on is the exchange rate. The exchange rate, you know, so far has moved within the range, not enough to really change the big picture. But if the exchange was to change in a dramatic way, that affect the affordability. That's probably the bigger question than memory content. Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer And last quarter, Sidney, we had the highest -- we shipped the highest percentage of our high memory content in eMCPs in Brazil ever. So they're buying, more than, not less last quarter. Sidney Ho -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst OK. That's very helpful. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Your line is now open. Rajvindra Gill -- Needham & Company -- Analyst Question also on the local content rules. You mentioned that you're targeting Wi-Fi, Bluetooth modules and IoT products in Brazil. Do those specific products also have local content rules similar to memory and mobile phones and PCs? And you mentioned 60% for batteries, I believe? Can you maybe expound on that? Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer So the little Wi-Fi, Bluetooth thing that we build today, which is just a little -- board-based solution does have some local content rules for PCs and -- but it's not a lot. But as we talk about getting more into, you know, more of the IoT stuff, we would anticipate that as, we ramped up our capabilities and production and the country grew that they would probably enact some type of rules around that. Ajay Shah -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer There's been a lot of interest from particularly government related agencies in promoting IoT for a variety of verticals. So they have actually put out a white paper related to IoT for agriculture, smart cities, energy management, a couple of different areas. So there's actually a lot of interest in that area and they want to make sure that they have domestic providers for these. Rajvindra Gill -- Needham & Company -- Analyst And just going back to Penguin. And I understand the dilemma that you're in. But we're trying to get a sense of what the core business is doing and forecasting in the future, not just the quarter. So it does look like the OPEX kind of moved up. If I -- the implied OPEX is up about, you know, call it, $10 million increase. And I'm looking at the revenue in fiscal year '17 for Penguin, what you said is a $166.5 million. I don't know what the growth rate will be next year. But any kind of color as we look at -- I mean, how do we model OPEX in November, February, May, August? How we model revenue for the future quarters? That was going to be a guess, you're going to take $166 million that you did and fiscal '17 grow by 20%. Otherwise you're going to have a model that -- so I was wondering if you could provide any more detail on that? Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer Yes, I mean those numbers you saw are probably in the first quarter, aren't the most worst numbers to use on a quarterly basis for Penguin. But you will get -- they have a little bit more variability in their quarters, so that's what we're trying to really get our hands on, right? I mean, our business tends to be a little more stable on a quarterly basis. They have a little more peaks and valleys and we're trying to get our handles around that, and once we get our handles around that then, you know, we definitely will come out with more information as to what's going on with that business. But if you want -- if you need something today, I'd say, their first-quarter numbers probably aren't the worst thing to use. You could... Rajvindra Gill -- Needham & Company -- Analyst OK, got it. That's helpful. And in terms of the currency. So the real depreciated against the dollar making the phones more expensive, PCs more expensive in Brazil. It doesn't appear to be that, that has had an effect on the unit demand of people buying phones and PCs. I mean, obviously from a P&L perspective, you're putting in GAAP as a loss. So I'm just wondering did you see any impact from demand? From a demand perspective, were you able to offset that by the pull-in? Or the higher-density phones? Just wondering if you can talk about that. Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer I mean, we had good demand in the quarter. And it was higher than we anticipated from the pull-ins. So we did not see any perceived weakness in demand in the quarter due to the real. And we talked about the facts that the real weakened enough, demand could slow down. In this quarter now we've got this -- we've got the shutdown for the World Cup, so it's kind of an anomaly in this quarter. I think it's going to take a little while to see what happens with the demand based on the real. Ajay Shah -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I mean, so far we're not -- anecdotally, we're not hearing any, you know, -- I mean put in some perspective, the Brazilian real is off by about 12% year to date. And when we look at that in the grand scheme of things, that's not going to completely change the demand picture. If the real were to significantly weaken from the here, it would force manufacturers to change the prices on the shelf. And that then might have an impact both in terms of which kind of phone the customer chooses as well as the total unit count. It's possible, but it's purely speculative at this point. We're not seeing a specific impact from what has happened so far. Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer Yes, I mean, you would think might happen as you might see the lower cost sell -- as Ajay mentioned, sell more than the higher ones. The last quarter, we sold more higher in memory than we have. And if you know -- if you look at our -- the results we expect, if you look at the second half results versus the first half, I mean, we expect that overall, we'll grow the business as we talked about in the call, right? So overall, I mean, our business will be up in the second half of the year versus the first half even though the second half, you know, the real will have weakened so... Rajvindra Gill -- Needham & Company -- Analyst Great. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Mark Lipacis -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Jack, maybe could you just review for us the exposure you have on the top line, the COGS and the OPEX to the real, what percentage of your cost structure is exposed to the real? And just spell out -- perhaps that just the mechanics of how the 4x losses is -- manifest on them, on that line item? Thank you. Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer Sure. I mean -- right. So on the FX loss, so as I said, I mean, where we are exposed really to the real from an FX perspective is that we purchased all of our wafers in dollars. And if we take those invoices, convert them into real, when we get them, and then when we go to pay them, we have to convert them back into USD. And so if the real has moved in that time period, well, either you're going to get an FX loss like we did in Q1, it goes right we had an FX gain in Q2, because it went the other way. Now this quarter, it dramatically weakened, and we've shown a much bigger FX loss than we had before. That's really our biggest exposure from a pure FX-loss standpoint. Now on the P&L, we price to our customers in dollar, so our exposure there was -- we do have to convert, of course, from dollars to real. If the real weakens or strengthens, I mean, it will have some impact on revenue but not a dramatic amount. And then if you look at our cost structure, you know, our local cost that are in real, when it weakens, in theory, we would get a little bit of a benefit in the rest of the P&L with the weaker real. Mark Lipacis -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. Thank you. And so is the COGS mostly dollar based? And is it the OPEX that is more heavily weighted to the real? Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer 85% of our COGS is, you know, material based, right? And materials are all going to be -- most of that for Samsung wafers coming in based on USD. Mark Lipacis -- Jefferies -- Analyst Gotcha. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Suji Desilva with Roth Capital. Your line is now open. Suji Desilva -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst Hi, Ajay and Jack. And congratulations on the results here. A couple of questions on Penguin. Did you have any inventory that had a mark up with the acquisition that needs to flow through that might dampen gross margin the next few quarters or was that not material? Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer We will have to do that. We haven't -- that's some of the stuff we haven't determined yet, Suji. But we know we have inventory that will have to get marked up. We're just not sure how much of it and where it has to go. Suji Desilva -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst So your gross margin guidance does not encompass that effect at this point? Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer Correct. Suji Desilva -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst OK. Good. Got it. And then also -- and I think this question's maybe premature as well but I'll ask anyway. This segment reporting, the way it is now, will it stay this way? Will you have a separate SCSS line or will it be combined into Specialty Memory? Any thoughts there and how you will report segments will be helpful. Thanks. Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer Yes. That's premature as you said, Suji. We thought about it. We haven't come to a definite conclusion yet. We're still -- see, you know, there is a lot analysis you have to do to determine, from a segment perspective, what you have to do. And so we're starting that analysis now. Suji Desilva -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst OK. Great. And last quick question on Specialty Memory. What percent of DDR4 versus DDR3 today? Is that shifting dramatically or staying stable? Jack Pacheco -- Chief Operating and Financial Officer That's about 30% DDR4 today. Suji Desilva -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst OK, great. Thanks, guys. Ajay Shah -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ajay Shah for any further remarks. Ajay Shah -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, again thank you, operator. Thank you to all of you for joining us on this call this afternoon. We look forward to seeing you out on the road in the coming months and to reporting on our progress next quarter. Once again, we thank you for your interest and goodbye.

SMART Global Holdings stock traders use a variety of tools to make a prediction on which way the SGH market is likely to head next. These tools can roughly be divided into indicators and chart patterns. When trying to make a SMART Global Holdings stock forecast, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall. Moving averages are among the most popular SMART Global Holdings stock prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for SGH stock over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for SGH is a sum of SGH\u2019s closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12. In addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action. 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the stock market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the SMART Global Holdings stock price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for SMART Global Holdings stock. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually interpreted as a negative forecast for the SGH market. Traders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the SMART Global Holdings stock price. When making a SMART Global Holdings stock forecast, most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of SMART Global Holdings stock with different granularity \u2013 for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremely short-term price action or choose a weekly candlestick chart to identify long-terms trends. 1-hour, 4-hour and 1-day candlestick charts are among the most popular. Let\u2019s use a 1-hour candlestick chart as an example of how this type of price chart gives us information about opening and closing prices. The chart is divided into \u201ccandles\u201d that give us information about SMART Global Holdings\u2019s stock price action in 1-hour chunks. Each candlestick will display SGH\u2019s opening price, closing price, as well as the highest and lowest prices that SMART Global Holdings reached within the 1-hour period. This information makes it easier to make an informed price prediction. It\u2019s also important to pay attention to the color of the candle \u2013 a green candle means that the closing price was higher than the opening price, while a red candle tells us the opposite. Some charts will use hollow and filled candlestick bodies instead of colors to represent the same thing. Just like with any other asset, the price action of SMART Global Holdings stock is driven by supply and demand. These dynamics can be influenced by fundamental factors, such as earnings announcements, new product launches, acquisitions and mergers, and other factors. The SGH stock price can also be influenced by market sentiment, broader economic conditions, interest rates, inflation rates and political developments. Some traders try to identify candlestick patterns when making stock price predictions to try and get an edge over the competition. Some candlestick formations are seen as likely to forecast bullish price action, while others are seen as bearish.

        "Extracted Text": "SMART Global Holdings Inc. has demonstrated significant growth in its high-margin services sector, with service revenue increasing from $31 million in the previous year to $60 million, which now constitutes 17% of overall sales. The company's non-GAAP gross margins have also reached a record 31.7% for FY23, improving from 29.2% in FY22, highlighting a successful focus on enhancing customer engagements. Additionally, the strong cash flow from operating activities, totaling $38 million in the fourth quarter, underscores the positive financial performance and operational efficiency of the business. SMART Global Holdings Inc. has reported a substantial decrease in revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, with guidance suggesting a 13.2% sequential decline and a 29.2% year-over-year decrease, primarily driven by decreases in its Specialty Memory and Intelligent Platform Solutions segments. The company's inventory levels have also been reduced, yet they remain elevated, indicating weak demand and potential oversupply issues particularly highlighted by key customers maintaining high inventory levels. Furthermore, management has pointed to lowered visibility in the high-performance computing (HPC) and AI markets, coupled with pressures from volatile memory pricing and diminished enterprise spending, contributing to a deteriorating outlook for SMART Global Holdings\u2019s financial performance.

You should consult your legal, tax, or financial advisors before making any financial decisions. This material is not intended as a recommendation, offer, or solicitation to purchase or sell securities, open a brokerage account, or engage in any investment strategy. Stocks, ETFs, Options, Bonds. Self-directed brokerage accounts and brokerage services for US-listed, registered securities, options, and Bonds, except for treasury securities offered through Jiko Securities, Inc., are offered to self-directed customers by Open to the Public Investing, Inc. (\u201cPublic Investing\u201d), a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA & SIPC. Additional information about your broker can be found by clicking here. Public Investing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Public Holdings, Inc. (\u201cPublic Holdings\u201d). This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Public Investing is not registered. Securities products offered by Public Investing are not FDIC insured. Apex Clearing Corporation, our clearing firm, has additional insurance coverage in excess of the regular SIPC limits. Additional information can be found here. Options. Certain requirements must be met in order to trade options. Options can be risky and are not suitable for all investors. Options transactions are often complex, and investors can rapidly lose the entire amount of their investment or more in a short period of time. Investors should consider their investment objectives and risks carefully before investing in options. Refer to the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options before considering any options transaction. Supporting documentation for any claims, if applicable, will be furnished upon request. Tax considerations with options transactions are unique and investors considering options should consult their tax advisor as to how taxes affect the outcome of each options strategy. Options Order Flow Rebates. If you are enrolled in our Options Order Flow Rebate Program, Public Investing will share a percentage of our estimated order flow revenue for each completed options trade as a rebate to help reduce your trading costs. Rebate rates vary monthly from $0.06-$0.18 and depend on your current and prior month\u2019s options trading volume. This rebate will be deducted from your cost to place the trade and will be reflected on your trade confirmation. To learn more, see our Options Rebate Program Terms & Conditions, Order Rebate FAQ and Fee Schedule. Bonds. \u201cBonds\u201d shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing. For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the \u201c Treasury Accounts\u201d section. Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes. A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account\u2019s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond\u2019s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond\u2019s YTW is not \u201clocked in\u201d until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The \u201clocked in\u201d YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our Fee Schedule. Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions. Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages. Read more about the risks associated with fixed income and fractional bonds. See Bond Account Disclosures to learn more. High-Yield Cash Account. A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing. Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (\u201cPartner Banks\u201d), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See here for a list of current Partner Banks. Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing. Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash. Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. Learn more. Cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency trading, execution, and custody services are provided by Bakkt Crypto Solutions, LLC (NMLS ID 1828849) (\u201cBakkt\u201d). Cryptocurrency is highly speculative, involves a high degree of risk, and has the potential for loss of the entire amount of an investment. Cryptocurrencies offered by Bakkt are not securities and are not FDIC insured or protected by SIPC. Your cryptocurrency assets are held in your Bakkt account. Bakkt is a licensed virtual currency business by the New York State Department of Financial Services and a licensed money transmitter, but is not a registered broker-dealer or a FINRA member. Your Bakkt Crypto account is separate from your brokerage account with Public Investing, which holds US-listed stocks and ETFs. Please review the Risk Disclosures before trading. Treasury Accounts. Investing services in treasury accounts offering 6 month US Treasury Bills on the Public platform are through Jiko Securities, Inc. (\u201cJSI\u201d), a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA & SIPC. See JSI\u2019s FINRA BrokerCheck and Form CRS for further information. JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 \u201cpar value\u201d (the T-bill\u2019s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill\u2019s yield represents the difference in price between the \u201cpar value\u201d and the \u201cdiscount price.\u201d Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. See Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures for further details. Investments in T-bills: Not FDIC Insured; No Bank Guarantee; May Lose Value. Banking services and bank accounts are offered by Jiko Bank, a division of Mid-Central National Bank. JSI and Jiko Bank are not affiliated with Public Holdings, Inc. (\u201cPublic\u201d) or any of its subsidiaries. None of these entities provide legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should consult your legal, tax, or financial advisors before making any financial decisions.

Keep in mind that other fees such as regulatory fees, Premium subscription fees, commissions on trades during extended trading hours, wire transfer fees, and paper statement fees may apply to your brokerage account. Please see Public\u2019s Investing\u2019s Fee Schedule to learn more. Fractional shares are illiquid outside of Public and not transferable. For a complete explanation of conditions, restrictions and limitations associated with fractional shares, see our Fractional Share Disclosure to learn more. Investment Plans. Investment Plans (\u201cPlans\u201d) shown in our marketplace are for informational purposes only and are meant as helpful starting points as you discover, research and create a Plan that meets your specific investing needs. Plans are self-directed purchases of individually-selected assets, which may include stocks, ETFs and cryptocurrency.

Plans are created using defined, objective criteria based on generally accepted investment theory; they are not based on your needs or risk profile. You are responsible for establishing and maintaining allocations among assets within your Plan. Plans involve continuous investments, regardless of market conditions.

        "Extracted Text": "CAMAS, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--nLIGHT, Inc. (Nasdaq: LASR), a leading provider of high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers used in the aerospace and defense, industrial, and microfabrication markets, today provided limited preliminary results for the fourth quarter of 2024. \u201cWe enter the year with good visibility across multiple programs in both directed energy and laser sensing, and we remain well-positioned for near- and long-term growth in aerospace and defense.\u201d The Company expects to report fourth quarter 2024 revenue in the range of $46 million to $48 million, below the Company\u2019s previously announced fourth quarter guidance range of $49 million to $54 million. The Company expects to report Laser Products revenue of $31 million to $32 million and Advanced Development revenue of approximately $15 million to $16 million. The anticipated revenue shortfall is due to several factors, including continued weakness in our industrial markets, execution challenges in our microfabrication business, and the timing of the delivery of a limited number of defense products. Primarily due to lower overall product revenue and several non-recurring charges related to the Company\u2019s efforts to rightsize its industrial business, the Company expects that both gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA will be materially below its previously announced fourth quarter guidance ranges. \u201cDespite the continued challenges in our commercial markets during the fourth quarter, I am optimistic about our overall business, particularly aerospace and defense, as we head into 2025,\u201d commented Scott Keeney, nLIGHT\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cWe enter the year with good visibility across multiple programs in both directed energy and laser sensing, and we remain well-positioned for near- and long-term growth in aerospace and defense.\u201d Scott Keeney, nLIGHT\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Joe Corso, nLIGHT\u2019s Chief Financial Officer are scheduled to participate in the 27th Annual Needham Growth Conference in New York, NY on Wednesday January 15th, 2025.

(Nasdaq: LASR), a leading provider of high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers used in the industrial, microfabrication, and aerospace and defense markets, today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2024. \u201cDriven by record results in Aerospace & Defense, third quarter revenue of $56.1 million was above the midpoint of our guidance range and increased 11% compared to the third quarter of 2023\u201d \"Driven by record results in Aerospace & Defense, third quarter revenue of $56.1 million was above the midpoint of our guidance range and increased 11% compared to the third quarter of 2023,\u201d commented Scott Keeney, nLIGHT\u2019s President & Chief Executive Officer. \u201cStrong execution across multiple programs in both directed energy and laser sensing resulted in record Aerospace & Defense product revenue during the quarter, and we remain well-positioned for near- and long-term growth in the Aerospace & Defense market.\u201d Mr. Keeney continued, \u201cA strong growth quarter in Microfabrication coupled with higher A&D products revenue enabled us to increase products gross margin to 29%, an improvement of approximately 500 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2023.

Gross margin was 22.4% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 19.6% for the third quarter of 2023. GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $10.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $11.9 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $3.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $4.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP metrics presented here to the most directly comparable GAAP metric have been provided in the tables included at the end of this release. Outlook For the fourth quarter of 2024, nLIGHT expects revenues to be in the range of $49 million to $54 million. The midpoint of $51.5 million includes Laser Products revenue of approximately $36.5 million and Advanced Development revenue of approximately $15 million. nLIGHT expects overall gross margin to be in the range of 17% to 21%, with Laser Products gross margin in the range of 21% to 25% and Advanced Development gross margin of approximately 8%. nLIGHT expects Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of ($5) million to ($2) million. We have not reconciled our outlook for Adjusted EBITDA because unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted nor can the probable significance be determined at this time. Accordingly, a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. Investor Conference Call at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time, Thursday, November 7, 2024 Parties interested in listening to nLIGHT\u2019s quarterly conference call may do so by dialing 1-800-579-2543 (U.S., toll-free) or +1-785-424-1789 (international and toll), with the conference title: nLIGHT Third Quarter 2024 Earnings. The call can also be accessed via the web by going to nLIGHT\u2019s Investor Relations page at http://investors.nlight.net. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Results In addition to U.S. GAAP results, this press release contains non-GAAP financial results, including Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted. We use Adjusted EBITDA to help us evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure of performance as it is commonly utilized by us and the investment community to analyze operating performance in our industry. Similarly, we believe that providing non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, is useful to our investors as they present an informative supplemental view of our results from period to period by removing the effect of stock-based compensation expense and other non-recurring items. However, the non-GAAP metrics presented herein are specific to us and may not be comparable to similar metrics disclosed by other companies because of differing methods used by other companies in calculating them. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for income tax expense (benefit), other non-operating income or expense, interest income or expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration-related costs, and other non-recurring items as determined by management, as applicable. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as GAAP net income (loss) adjusted for stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles, acquisition and integration-related costs, and other non-recurring items as determined by management, as applicable. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, as non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the respective period plus the dilutive effect of any common stock equivalents during the period in the case of non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, diluted. Tables presenting the reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, as well as the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income (loss) and GAAP to non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, are included at the end of this press release.

Investor Conference Call at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time, Thursday, August 1, 2024 Parties interested in listening to nLIGHT\u2019s quarterly conference call may do so by dialing 1-844-282-4705 (U.S., toll-free) or +1-412-317-5625 (international and toll), with the conference title: nLIGHT Second Quarter 2024 Earnings. The call can also be accessed via the web by going to nLIGHT\u2019s Investor Relations page at http://investors.nlight.net. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Results In addition to U.S. GAAP results, this press release contains non-GAAP financial results, including Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted. We use Adjusted EBITDA to help us evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure of performance as it is commonly utilized by us and the investment community to analyze operating performance in our industry. Similarly, we believe that providing non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, is useful to our investors as they present an informative supplemental view of our results from period to period by removing the effect of stock-based compensation expense and other non-recurring items. However, the non-GAAP metrics presented herein are specific to us and may not be comparable to similar metrics disclosed by other companies because of differing methods used by other companies in calculating them. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for income tax expense (benefit), other non-operating income or expense, interest income or expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration-related costs, and other non-recurring items as determined by management, as applicable. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as GAAP net income (loss) adjusted for stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles, acquisition and integration-related costs, and other non-recurring items as determined by management, as applicable. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, as non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the respective period plus the dilutive effect of any common stock equivalents during the period in the case of non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, diluted. Tables presenting the reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, as well as the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income (loss) and GAAP to non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, are included at the end of this press release.

        "Extracted Text": "One analyst muses: Is this the next IPG Photonics? Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and \"initiate coverage\" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope... Move over IPG Photonics (IPGP 1.03%). There's a new laser maker in town -- and Wall Street loves it. It's been nearly a month now since tiny laser maker nLIGHT (LASR -3.66%) debuted on the Nasdaq. Up till now, the bankers who underwrote the IPO had been stuck in a \"quiet period\" in which they were unable to comment on the company's prospects. Now, that quiet period has ended -- and you can hardly shut them up about it. No fewer than six separate bankers, including all five of those that underwrote the IPO, announced new ratings for nLIGHT this morning, according to data from StreetInsider.com (subscription required) and TheFly.com. What's more, all six rate the stock buy. RED LIGHT? GREEN LIGHT? WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR STOCK IN LASER MAKER NLIGHT? IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Needham & Co calls nLIGHT \"a small-cap version of a young IPG Photonics.\" Like fiber laser maker IPG, nLIGHT \"is highly vertically integrated,\" says Needham. And while much smaller than IPG (nLIGHT has a market capitalization of $1 billion, while IPG Photonics comes in at $13 billion), Needham believes \"it can make up for [what it lacks in scale with] differentiated technology that will enable it to generate 25% growth over the next several years, with steadily improving profitability.\" DA Davidson likewise believes nLIGHT is an \"emerging player\" and likely \"to grow at [a] double-digit annual pace for several years.\" Davidson argues that both customers and investors are looking for an alternative to IPG to reduce dependence on just one company's laser products. In the near term, Davidson is projecting 26% sales growth and 50% earnings growth for nLIGHT next year. Stifel agrees the company will show \"above average\" growth and argues nLIGHT stock deserves a debt-adjusted valuation of about four times annual sales (not trailing sales, mind you -- but the sales it's expected to make in fiscal 2020). Canaccord Genuity focuses on nLIGHT's \"technological differentiation and significant margin leverage potential through vertical integration\" as reasons to own the stock.

Raymond James (which helped the underwrite the IPO) and Northcoast Research (which didn't) also agree the stock is a buy. Target prices range from $34 a share (Needham) to $40 a share (Davidson and Stifel). If these analysts are right, nLIGHT stock that costs about $30 today could gain as much as 33% over the next 12 months, giving the stock a market cap of about $1.3 billion. That's pretty incredible, given that less than a month ago, in the days leading up to its IPO, nLIGHT's backers were only hoping to sell the stock for between $13 and $15 a share, resulting in a market capitalization of no more than $510 million. By IPO eve, though, that valuation had risen to $16 a share ($543 million market cap). And by the time the IPO actually happened, on April 26, the stock was off to the races, soaring nearly 70% from its $16 offering price to close nearly at $27 a share. Such a quick run-up naturally raises the question of whether nLIGHT's potential is already priced in. Clearly, the company's backers don't think so. Are they right? That's actually very hard to say -- for now. You see, although nLIGHT has been in business since 2000 and is an established company with nearly $140 million in annual sales, it currently has no free cash flow to value it on -- and barely any profits. Trailing-12-month net income at the company is a mere $1.8 million, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, or about $0.05 per share. Thus, valued on those earnings, nLIGHT stock sells for about 600 times earnings today. Analysts expect nLIGHT's earnings to increase rapidly from here, however, with consensus projections calling for profits of $0.38 per share this year, growing 68% to $0.64 in 2019, and then another 53% in 2020, to $0.98 per share. (Free cash flow is also expected to turn positive in 2019.) If nLIGHT can maintain this pace, well, $0.64 in 2019 earnings divided into $30 a share would work out to a P/E of just under 47, and that would seem a fair price to pay for a company growing at 53% to 68% annually. Still, nLIGHT is expected to report its first earnings as a public company just two days from now, after close of trading on Wednesday, May 23. With earnings so close at hand, my advice to investors considering the stock would be to hold off on buying right now, and see what management has to say about nLIGHT's performance and prospects later this week. There'll be plenty of time to buy then if the news is good enough. Before you buy stock in Nlight, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nlight wasn\u2019t one of them.

We started the year with the hope of a global manufacturing recovery after a difficult 2019. But early in the year, we faced the profound uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the year, our global team met the unprecedented challenges of this crisis, and we not only were able to operate safely, but we also ended the year with record revenue. In 2020, we generated $223 million of revenue, which was an increase of 26% over 2019 and in line with our long-term historical compound annual growth rate of 23%. We exited Q4 with 50% growth over Q4 2019. And while our future growth will be subject to global macroeconomic factors, we believe over the long run, that our strategy will enable us to meet or exceed our historical long-term revenue compound annual growth rate of greater than 20%. Turning to Slide 4. Breaking down revenue by end market, I will begin with aerospace and defense. 2020 marked the fourth consecutive year of annual growth in our aerospace and defense business. We grew 2020 revenues 36% on an organic basis, and we grew 102% year-over-year when including the $31.8 million contribution from Nutronics. We have been serving the aerospace and defense market since we founded nLIGHT 2 decades ago, and we view ourselves as a dual-use technology company. We have a long history of supplying mission-critical lasers into long-running programs and our work in directed energy represents an important long-term opportunity. November marked the 1-year anniversary of our acquisition of Nutronics, and I'm happy to report that the integration of nLIGHT and Nutronics has gone well. Confirming our fundamental thesis, that being vertically integrated from the semiconductor laser through being control is critical to developing high-power cost-effective lasers required for directed energy applications. Today, we believe we are the only laser company with this level of vertical integration, which offers us a competitive advantage as directed energy applications are expected to move to programs of record. Turning to the industrial end market. Our business grew 10% year-over-year in 2020. We saw continued demand growth in China beginning in mid-2020 that continues today, particularly as our customers continue their migration toward higher power laser solutions. In contrast, our global industrial customers generally operate at lower power levels and value our differentiated programmable laser technology. The sales cycle for many of these global industrial customers is quite long and the design wins we've secured offer significant long-term growth potential. We're also excited about the opportunities we have in metal additive manufacturing with our newly introduced AFX 1000 single-mode programmable laser. Turning to microfabrication. In 2020, our microfabrication sales declined by 10% year-over-year. However, after bottoming in Q1, we saw a rebound in our microfabrication business beginning in the second quarter that continued throughout the year. And in Q4, our market fabrication revenues increased by 15% versus the comparable period in 2019. We continue to improve performance and reduce costs of our high power, high-brightness semiconductor lasers, which we believe, will enable us to meet the growing demand from a broad base of electronics manufacturing applications that require the use of lasers. We expect that the microfabrication market will be driven by continued improvements in next-generation applications in 5G networks and handsets as well as the increased use of flexible printed circuits in consumer electronics devices, medical applications, displays and other advanced electronics applications. Turning to Slide 5. In 2020, we increased our revenue in all geographies. In China, our 2020 revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $70.9 million. Full year 2020 sales to customers outside of China grew 35% year-over-year to $151.9 million, representing 68% of our total revenue versus 64% in 2019. Turning to Slide 6. In the fourth quarter, we had record quarterly revenue of $66 million, and we grew 53% year-over-year with growth in all of our end markets. Beginning with aerospace and defense, we grew revenues 57% year-over-year on an organic basis and 122%, including the $12.5 million contribution from Nutronics. A&D revenue in the quarter was driven by executing against long-term contracts with our core aerospace and defense customers and ongoing direct energy development work. Our industrial business grew 29% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Growth in our industrial business was driven across all geographies as demand for both high-power and programmable fiber lasers continue to increase. Finally, within microfabrication, our sales increased 15% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. During the quarter, we saw positive demand trends from multiple customers across a wide range of microfabrication applications. Moving to Slide 7, to discuss our quarterly revenue by geography. In China, our revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $18.2 million. Fourth quarter sales to customers outside of China grew 70% year-over-year to $47.5 million, representing 72% of total revenue versus 65% in Q4 2019. I will now turn the call over to Ran to discuss nLIGHT's full year and Q4 financial results. Ran Bareket -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Beginning on Slide 9. nLIGHT delivered record organic and inorganic revenue for both full year 2020 and in the fourth quarter. Full year 2020 revenue of $222.8 million was up 26% year-over-year and up 10% when adjusting for the $31.8 million contribution from Nutronics. Total revenue includes $184.8 million of product revenue and $37.9 million of development revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of $65.7 million was above the high end of our outlook, up 53% year-over-year and up 72% on an organic basis when adjusting for the $12.5 million contribution from Nutronics. Total revenue includes $51.7 million of product revenue and $14 million of development revenue. For year 2020, gross margin was 26.6% compared with 29.6% in the full year of 2019. Product gross margin was 30.6% for full year 2020 compared to 29.9% in the full year of 2019. Gross margin was 29.9% in the first quarter compared with 23.3% in the comparable period of 2019. Product gross margin was 35.9% in the fourth quarter compared to 24% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Turning to Slide 10 to provide more detail into our gross margins. It is important to remember that nLIGHT reports its revenue and gross margin in 2 segments: product and development. Our development gross margins are associated preliminary with advanced technology development projects for the U.S. government, including the work we performed at Nutronics. Prior to the acquisition of Nutronics in November 2019, we reported our business and gross margin in a single segment. While we have always worked on advanced technology development programs, revenues from those programs were not material. Therefore, when evaluating our gross margin trends over time, it is important to compare what we classified as product gross margin today with our overall gross margin prior to the acquisition of Nutronics in Q4 2019. In the fourth quarter, we generated product gross margin of approximately 36%, which were approximately 1,200 basis points higher than our product gross margin in Q4 last year. While some of those improvement in our product gross margin is associated with higher revenue level, the 2 primary drivers for our product gross margin expansion is increased product sales to strategic industrial and aerospace customer outside of China and continued cost performance improvement of our semiconductor lasers. As we look forward to the future, we believe that we can expand our product gross margin above 40%. This improvement will not be linear and will experience fluctuation quarter-over-quarter. We believe that our focus on strategic growth with our commercial customer outside of China, a growing proportion of sales to the high-power segments of the market in China, and continued success in our core defense business will enable us to further improve our gross margin over time. Turning to Slide 11. Operating expenses without stock-based compensation were $15.4 million during the fourth quarter compared with $15 million in Q4 2019. While we remain focused on controlling our operating expenses, we continue to invest in research and development to capitalize on an expanding set of organic growth opportunities. Turning to Slide 12. Non-GAAP net income for full year 2020 was $7.3 million compared with $1.1 million during 2019. Non-GAAP EPS for full year 2020 was $0.17 per diluted share compared with $0.03 per diluted shares in 2019. On a GAAP basis, EPS for full year 2020 was a loss of $0.55 compared with a loss of $0.35 during 2019. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $5.2 million compared with a loss of $2.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.12 per diluted share compared with a loss of $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. On a GAAP basis, EPS for the fourth quarter was a loss of $0.12 compared with a loss of $0.29 during the fourth quarter of 2019. Full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $18.2 million or 8.1% of revenues. This compares to $9.9 million or 5.6% of sales during 2019. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $8.4 million or 12.9% of sales. This compared with a loss of $1.4 million in Q4 2019. Our improvement in adjusted EBITDA in both the full year and in Q4 was a result of higher gross margin and strong operating expenses control. It also demonstrates the operating leverage we generate from incremental product sales. During 2020, we generated approximately $13 million of operating cash versus a use of $4.3 million in 2019. While our operating cash flow will fluctuate on a quarterly basis, as it did in the fourth quarter, when we consumed $1.7 million of operating cash, we continue to focus on maintaining the appropriate amount of working capital on our balance sheet to support our strong growth. Our capital expenditures for the full year of 2020 were $23.4 million. Included in this number is approximately $12.5 million that we used to purchase our Camas facility in early 2020. Excluding our expenditure on our Camas facility, CapEx as a percentage of sales was approximately 5%. We expect to continue to invest in CapEx related mainly to facility automation, infrastructure and manufacturing capacity. Turning to Slide 13. We ended Q4 with total cash and cash equivalents of $102 million. DSO for the fourth quarter was 38 days. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $55 million, representing 106 days in inventory. Our DSO and days of inventory remained relatively consistent with prior quarter. Turning to Page 14 for the outlook for Q1. Based on the information available today, we expect Q1 of 2021 revenues to be in the range of $56 million to $62 million. At the midpoint of $59 million, this includes approximately $47 million of product sales and approximately $12 million of development sales. The midpoint of our revenue guidance implied year-over-year growth of 37%. Based on our current expectation for product mix, we see gross margin for Q1 2021 in a range of 25% to 29%. Product gross margin is expected to be in the range of 30% to 34%. We expect development gross margin to be approximately 6.5%. For the first quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $3 million to $6 million. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA range assume that OpEx without stock-based compensation will increase slightly, and depreciation and amortization is approximately $3.8 million. We expect Q1 average basis share to be approximately 39.9 million. With that, I will turn back the call to Scott. Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Ran. We continue to believe in the long-term growth opportunities for semiconductor and fiber lasers and that we are well positioned to outgrow the broader market. We believe that the market growth will be driven by 2 key factors: first, technology will continue to improve in a Moore's Law like cadence, which will enable lasers to continue to displace legacy technologies. Second, there are a broad range of end market catalysts that will drive demand, including long-term secular drivers from electric vehicles, additive manufacturing use for series production, adoption of next-generation 5G infrastructure and handsets and new aerospace and defense applications. Our core strategy positions us well to increase our share of this growing market. nLIGHT is solely focused on provided high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers, and we believe that our vertically integrated business model is a critical differentiator. We continue to focus on the global industrial and aerospace and defense markets, which are the 2 key areas that we believe will drive our growth going forward. The combination of our technology and product portfolio, customer traction, new product introductions and a commitment to these markets offers attractive growth opportunities. Over the past 20 years, we have remained tenaciously focused on the promise of high-power lasers, and the last year marks an important year in our history. I'd like to thank all of our employees for their exceptional performance and what shaped up to be a very challenging year in which to safely operate and grow a global business. With that, I will turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Operator [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from John Marchetti with Stifel. John Marchetti -- Stifel -- Analyst Scott [Phonetic] take a moment and just talk through maybe -- in the deck, you gave the breakdown by the different power levels. And it looked like high-power was a little bit weaker, where the strength really came through at the low-power end. And if you could just provide a little bit of color around some of the dynamics there, I would appreciate that. Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer Sure, John, it's Scott. No problem. So yes, we didn't emphasize the power here because it gets a little more complex. The bottom line is our growth outside of China was swamping the growth in the high power. So as you recall, in China, there's a tendency to use relatively higher power fiber lasers for cutting; whereas in the global industrial customers outside of China, there's less focus on the extreme high powers and more focus on the high-performance and notably the programmability that we provide. So as we grow outside of China, that brings that average down. We continue to see, nevertheless, a general expansion in high-power both in China and the rest of the world. It's just that the relative levels between the 2 are different today. John Marchetti -- Stifel -- Analyst Got it. Okay. And then just on the margin side, Ran, if I can. When I think about your guidance for next quarter coming off of the 36% or so that you did non-GAAP and product gross margin in this last quarter. Is that largely a function of mix? How do I think about that step down from the 36% in this most quarter to sort of a midpoint of 32%, given the outlook. Is it volume driven? Is it mix driven? Just curious for some color there? Ran Bareket -- Chief Financial Officer It is -- sure. It is both. It is volume-driven, and it's a mix driven. Operator The next question will come from Greg Palm with Craig-Hallum Capital. Greg Palm -- Craig-Hallum Capital -- Analyst Nice results. Maybe just starting off, would love to get your kind of thoughts on an order commentary thus far for Q1. I mean, any areas of strength, either by segment or geography that you want to call out? Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Thanks, Greg. Scott here. Yes, nothing really calling out right now. We've continued to see improvements in microfab. We've really seen improvements throughout 2020 in all areas. As we said, the growth through the year, it was accelerating through the year. So we've seen that to continue. You always have Q1, the Chinese New Year uncertainty. I think underneath that, as you may know, this year in China, there's far less travel, which probably will shorten and reduce the impact of Chinese New Year this year, but you never know until you're on the other side of that. So in general, throughout 2020, we saw acceleration in all of our markets and certainly heading into this year with the promise of a vaccine, certainly anticipating continued strength. Greg Palm -- Craig-Hallum Capital -- Analyst Okay. Maybe if I could expand upon that last answer I mean, I know you don't typically give full year guidance. But just in terms of the cadence of how the year might shake out, I mean, going back a few years, I recall sort of Q1 starting off as the low point in building throughout the year. The last 2, I think, have been a little bit unique with all the puts and takes. Maybe just remind us kind of how you're thinking about seasonal trends this year. Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Let me remind you, typically, Q1 in the industrial market is the softest because of Chinese New Year. And then conversely, Q2 tends to be one of the more dramatic growth quarters as we come out of Chinese New Year. And you fold in some other cycles around microfabrication and upgrades and whatnot, it gets a little more complex there. But that's, to the extent there is a cadence, that's typically what we've seen. You layer in, each segment has different dynamics in aerospace and defense. We're working on the government budget cycle. So there's a little bit there. But the first order, I think, it's that Q1 softer, Q2 stronger because of industrial, it's probably the most pronounced sort of trend we typically see. Operator The next question will come from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Jim Ricchiuti -- Needham & Company -- Analyst I just wondering if you could expand a little bit about the strength you're seeing in industrial outside of China for some of the programmable lasers. Where is that -- maybe you could talk a little bit, Scott, about the key applications where you're getting traction? Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer Absolutely, Jim. Let's see a few things. All three segments are important. I'll start with cutting. In cutting, it's a market that we had smaller share to date. It's a market where the design in -- it's a long process to get designed in. And we've worked through that over the last really 5 years. And the introduction of our programmable fiber lasers, I think, has been instrumental in our design wins there. So we've continued to make progress in that market with key larger customers. I think as we look ahead this year, Jim, I think the big trade show there, at least in the U.S. would be fab tech, and then Europe will follow thereafter. And so there'll be more information later this year. But we continue to make traction because of our programmability. Similarly, in the welding markets, it's a very different set of markets, much more fragmented. But I'd say the high level there is to think about the EV from battery through new OEMs, and we've got some good design wins there. But much more fragmented markets. There aren't as big design wins tend not to be as large. And then finally, in additive manufacturing in Q4, we launched our AFX product, which is our programmable fiber laser for that market. And we've been working in that space for many years now. I think that product launch has exceeded our expectations. And I think we're really demonstrating some really pretty fundamental advantages in that market. It's the smallest of the 3 markets, but it is one that is starting to inflect, where the productivity that we're seeing is such that attitude is going beyond the really niche applications and into some really important higher volume applications. So continue to make traction there. So really all those markets, that's a short summary of what we see going on. Jim Ricchiuti -- Needham & Company -- Analyst That's helpful, Scott. And just on the microfabrication business. Well, let me back up a second. And again, not looking for guidance necessarily beyond Q1. But can you characterize the visibility in the industrial business and microfabrication business, looking out beyond the quarter, just to give us a sense as to what you're seeing. For instance, are you seeing any pickup as a result of the stronger smartphone cycle in microfabrication? Or is that still a relatively small part of the business? Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Good, Jim. So in terms of visibility, just kind of high-level again. In some sense, defense, we have the best visibility, the longest term sort of outlook. Probably industrial is second, although it is much more limited. And then finally, microfabrication is probably the least visibility. We have indications of where things are going. But because that market is so fragmented, and we're also back in the channel, we focus on the semiconductor laser that goes into other lasers that go into the systems go to that market. It's more difficult to get a very clear read on what we see. Having said that, we are seeing pickup. And yes, we believe that part of that is driven by 5G new consumer electronics that are using lasers in new ways. But again, it's a broad based market. And we've talked a little bit about medical in the past. That's an area where we see some continued expansion in that space. And then going forward, we continue to see that market proliferating and opening up quite a large number of new applications. Jim Ricchiuti -- Needham & Company -- Analyst What was that growth that you saw in Q4, that 15% in the microfabrication, was that more or less in line with your expectations? Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer Oh, boy, I think -- in Q4, I think it was a bit better than we were expecting certainly for Q4, but not out of line with our expectations. Operator The next question will come from Jed Dorsheimer with Canaccord Genuity. Jed Dorsheimer -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Congrats on the quarter. First one, just on the upstream. I'm curious on the manufacturing, what the wavelength range is across your product offering from a materials perspective, not frequency doubling? Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Good, Jed. So we, boy, go down to -- it's pretty niche at 600-odd nanometers, really niche. And then at the opposite extreme, again, really niche would be just under 2-micron wavelength. So we do have a very broad range of wavelengths that we cover. We do a little bit in the blue, actually. But again, really pretty niche today. The vast majority of what we do is, well, around 1 micron for most of the applications. Jed Dorsheimer -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Got it. And do you think -- the reason that I'm asking is just with the aerospace and defense business, kind of being a focus area and particularly around directed energy, do you see that as being the area in terms of potential expansion on the upstream? Or do you think -- or from a wavelength perspective, it will be tight around that range that you have? Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Good. So in -- generally, in defense and particularly in defense -- in directed energy, it's generally around 1 micron. There are applications for longer wavelengths, the \"eye-safe\" wavelengths of 1,500 nanometers or so. So there are some applications there, but by and large, the directed energy applications are around 1 micron. You do get to other wavelengths for other applications, and you quickly get into some classified applications. But the volume today and likely in the future is around 1 micron. Jed Dorsheimer -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Got it. And so on the eye-safe, that would require indium phosphide if you're not using it a doubling? Or is -- are you able to achieve that with some other material? Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. There's sort of at least 2 ways to guess there, Jed. One is with indium phosphide semiconductor lasers, and we have been a leader in that space for quite a long time. So we do that directly with our own semiconductor lasers. The other -- one other way to get there is through -- well, through fiber lasers with different rare earths. So thulium is one example of that. erbium would be another. And so you can pump those fiber lasers at, let's call it, more typical semiconductor laser wavelengths to get those longer wavelengths for these applications. Jed Dorsheimer -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Got it. One last question around here. With some of the changes going on from an industry perspective and the discussion around sort of the benefits of the vertical integration that you have, do you think that there's going to be -- that there's a greater need from pull from the end application further downstream or not? Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer Well, let's see. Obviously, a lot going on and hard to speculate on what outcomes will be. But I think philosophically, what we believe is that there are 2 things that matter at the fundamental level. One is that, that focus matters a lot and no pun intended with lasers. We are solely focused on high-power well, semiconductor base lasers, directly semiconductor lasers and fiber lasers pump by the semiconductor lasers. We're solely focused on that high-power market. And that means there are a whole set of technologies and indeed sort of business systems that are associated with that focus. That's all we do. That's point 1. Point 2 is that we do think that, that vertical integration to do that is important. And that was a core thesis for why we acquired Nutronics was that we believe that the vertical integration was required really to optimize from the chip through the beam combination be control in this case, and to really make sure that there were no sort of breaks in that value chain to optimize across that. And we do believe firmly in really both those principles. And so we'll see how the industry evolves with what's going on. But that's really -- that's core to what we believe is critical. Operator The next question will come from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Tom Diffely -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst First, Ran, with regards to your guidance on the advanced development part of the business being down as well. Is there normal seasonality in the defense business? Or is that just kind of quarterly lumpiness that we're looking at? Ran Bareket -- Chief Financial Officer No, it's quarterly lumpiness. There is no seasonality with the defense in general. Tom Diffely -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst Okay. Great. And then Scott, kind of similar to what Jim was asking earlier. When you look at your semi-laser business versus your fiber laser business, which one do you think is a bigger component of growth in 2021? Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer For '21 and really beyond what we're focused on is the industrial market for those global players and the vast majority of that is going to be driven by fiber lasers. Similarly, the directed energy application in defense will also be driven by fiber lasers. Important to remember that the semiconductor laser is critical technology in there. So there's really important product development that we're working on that supports that, but the end product for those 2 key growth areas are fiber lasers. Tom Diffely -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst Okay. And then -- and the final question then related to that, has the margin structure for you between fiber lasers and semi lasers come down? Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer I don't want to dodge the question because -- but it is very complex. We don't break out the margin across their -- there are certain fiber laser categories that have much higher margins and there's some that -- where it's more commoditized and lower margins. So there's dispersion across really both those and we're showing continued improvement in our margins over the past few quarters, and we anticipate to continue to make improvements in product margins. Having said that, our primary focus is on continued growth and adoption in those key markets we're talking about. And as we've talked about before, that product margin is a little less meaningful when it comes to, especially the R&D revenue associated with direct energy right now. Tom Diffely -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst Okay. I should ask, any impact from the unexpected snowstorm in the area? Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, a little bit. Yes, we had one snow and ice here in the Portland region. Luckily, we had power on the Washington side, but a few of our employees on the Portland side are still struggling a little bit. But -- Yes, we're getting by it. Operator The next question will come from Paretosh Misra with Berenberg Capital Markets. Paretosh Misra -- Berenberg Capital Markets -- Analyst Great. So just curious if you could provide any color on your order book as to what you're seeing? And how is it versus this time last year? Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. We don't really -- we do not break out our bookings. I will say that we did see continued acceleration in our markets throughout the year across all of the markets, and we're getting good visibility. But it's always difficult in Q1 with Chinese New Years, as I've said before, to have much longer term visibility. But I will say this, there's a strong funnel of opportunities across all of the markets that we serve, and we continue to make traction in all of them. Paretosh Misra -- Berenberg Capital Markets -- Analyst Got it. And then maybe if I could ask one more. Any sense you could -- you have -- how big is the automotive business for you? I'm guessing it's all within the industrial. And within that, any thoughts on the electric battery business, like how big is that for you right now? Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Good. On a sort of relative basis, our exposure to automotive is relatively modest. We are relatively less penetrated into the automotive exposure. But we do have some exposure. Obviously, there's some through cutting, but probably there's more through the welding set of applications. And indeed, as you alluded to, it's really the EV space that has opened up more opportunities for us. And it goes from the battery manufacturers, notably in Korea, Asia, China, to the new OEMs around the world that are developing new cars, new car parts that are using our lasers for both cutting and for welding. And again, as I mentioned, it's a pretty fragmented market. I think we have significant room to continue to grow in that space. It's a market that is expanding. It is opening up a number of new applications for lasers. And it's a market that our products are well positioned for in a number of those key markets, and we have room to continue to grow. Operator [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Mark Miller with The Benchmark Company. Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Yes. I was just wondering in terms of the breakout of fiber laser sales, how did they do above 6 kilowatts was that stronger this quarter or weaker? Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. We did break out, Mark, the detail, you can find it out there. And this quarter, on a relative basis, the above 6-kilowatt was a little lower. I think -- yes. I mean -- sorry, Ran, do you want to jump in the numbers? Ran Bareket -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Mark, it was, it was 47% this quarter versus 58% in Q3 or 54% in Q2. Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. So as I said, and we saw that really across the industry, too, it's interesting. You can note that. And as I mentioned before, Mark, as we grow in the global -- in China, there's a tendency to use higher power fiber lasers on a relative basis over the rest of the world. As we go into the rest of the world, that average would be dampened a bit. But we do see the continued trend to higher power across the globe. Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst In terms of the Chinese market at the lower -- and has that situation stabilized in terms of pricing? Scott Keeney -- Chief Executive Officer We don't see dramatic changes there. I think we have seen some of the lower power players in that space struggle and hard to know where a few of them have gone. So the level of -- the number of competitors there, certainly, we don't see that expanding. And we don't see dramatic changes in that market. Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Just a couple of housekeeping issues. Your tax rate has been jumping around. What should we estimate for 2021? Ran Bareket -- Chief Financial Officer So on a quarterly basis, you should estimate roughly $200,000 to $300,000 expense a quarter. Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Okay. And stock-based compensation, that's going to be around -- it's been lower this quarter, it's going to be around $5 million or $6 million. Is that a good estimate? Ran Bareket -- Chief Financial Officer No. This quarter, it was around $9 million, and that estimate should remain for 2021 as well. Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst So, it will be $9 million in the first quarter of this year also? Ran Bareket -- Chief Financial Officer Roughly.

Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Charlotte, and happy new year to everyone joining us this morning to discuss Acuity Brands. I'm proud of our performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Our team delivered sales growth of 17%, expanded our operating profit margin by 160 basis points, and increased diluted EPS by 57%, despite global supply chain challenges and unpredictable market conditions. Our performance demonstrates that by prioritizing customers, we are driving sales growth and turning that into operating income, while continuing to invest in the long-term growth and transformation of the company. I want to start today's call by taking a deep dive on the current market conditions. As you are aware, this is a dynamic market with a fair share of paradoxes. Demand across our end markets remain strong. At the same time, the availability and cost of key inputs remain challenging. In short, it's the best of times and the most challenging of times. First, on demand. Business is strong both in ABL and in spaces. Within ABL, demand is strong across all of our channels to market, except retail, which we expect to improve this calendar year. In this dynamic pricing environment, we have been prudent and successful passing on price increases, while at the same time, providing as much consistency as we can to our customers so that they can plan and execute their projects effectively. At the same time, input costs and availability remain unpredictable, and we expect this to continue. Obviously, everyone is dealing with this. Our strategy for managing through this has been consistent: prioritize satisfying customer demand and ensuring the health and well-being of our associates. So now let me spend a minute on what we mean by satisfying our customer demand. First, we have chosen to honor pricing on all of our placed orders. As I've said before, it is important to me that we are known in the industry for doing what we say. There is a gap in time between when we receive orders and when we fulfill them in normal times, and that is even greater now. Therefore, we believe that this position will serve us well in the long term with specific customers and with the industry. From there, we are also doing everything that we can to fulfill these orders as quickly as we can. While we don't disclose backlog, what I will say is that it is meaningfully higher than during normal periods. This is the result of higher demand, coupled with changing component availability and the general supply chain and transportation challenges. Again, these are not unique to Acuity. To combat these, we have prioritized three key activities. First, we have focused and invested in our strategic relationships with manufacturers and suppliers to procure as much of the available component supply as possible. We benefit from being the largest and most consistent in the industry. Second, we have empowered our teams to source components in the spot market, and we have prioritized speed and access over cost. This allows us to maintain higher levels of production at the expense of some higher cost. Third, our product, engineering and manufacturing teams have been continuously redesigning and reengineering existing products based on what components are available. To give you an idea of the magnitude of that effort, our Distech engineers spent over half their time in the last quarter dedicated to this type of redesign. Our ABL team made the same commitment in addition to changes and improvements in our manufacturing processes to ensure consistent production. These efforts also extend beyond our company into our broader ecosystem. We have been working with suppliers to help them find necessary components and make engineering changes in the products that they supply to us. The overall effort has been herculean, and our teams continue to remain flexible and to adapt to an ever changing environment. The changes that we have implemented over the last two years have enhanced our ability to see across our business, work across our stakeholders and improve our service levels. So where are we on our transformation? One of the points that I stress to our team is that transformation is a process, not a destination. In challenging times, sometimes, the first reaction is to revert to what you know. In our case, we are using these times to redouble our transformation efforts. Let me start with the ABL business. Trevor and his team are focused on maintaining high product vitality, continuing to elevate industry service levels and continuing to use technology to differentiate us. During the first quarter, we launched several interesting products to drive our portfolio expansion, products like the STACK PACK and STACK Switch products. These are the next generation of center-element LED lay-in lights for commercial indoor spaces. The STACK has a lower profile and more efficient packaging that saves on transportation costs. It also has an adjustable lumen output that can be reconfigured at any time through the STACK Switch. This means that there is no time wasted on a job site if there need to be changes to the configuration. In controls, we introduced the CLAIRITY link. This is part of our nLight lighting controls platform that offers remote connectivity capability. The remote capabilities reduce the need for in-person visits, offering quick troubleshooting resolutions and a reduction in maintenance cost. This product fundamentally changes the way we service projects and is an important step forward for our customers. Now moving to the Intelligent Spaces Group. The mission of ISG is to use technology to solve problems in spaces in order to make them smarter, safer, and greener. We do this in two ways. We collect data through hardware, for example, the Distech controller; and then analyze and take action on the data through software applications powered by Atrius. Our ISG group had an eventful quarter. As I mentioned, even though the engineering team at Distech spend over half their time focused on redesigning Distech products for the available components. We continued to roll out several important products and product enhancements. The Distech ECLYPSE APEX was introduced in the first quarter and is the most advanced version of our controller for HVAC and building automation. The APEX introduced artificial intelligence to the edge and increases compute capacity in buildings, which helps customers manage energy usage more effectively.We also further expanded the availability of our Atrius Building Insights service by enabling it for additional languages and local privacy requirements. Atrius Building Insights is now available in the U.K., Ireland, France, Germany, Spain, and Norway. As I turn the call over to Karen, I want to take a step back. We are currently and expect to continue to be operating in unpredictable times. Input prices and availability can sometimes feel like a game of whack-a-mole, and we are dealing with omicron, which materialized only a few months ago. As we face these challenges and new challenges we will maintain our focus on satisfying customer demand in ensuring the health and well-being of our associates. I remain optimistic about 2022 and our ability to effectively manage in this environment. We have a great team who are executing today while also remaining focused on the long-term growth and transformation of the company. I'll now turn the call over to Karen, who will take a deeper dive into our performance. And then I'll be back for the Q&A and for some closing remarks. Karen Holcom -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Neil. I want to start by thanking our team for their work over the last quarter in this environment. I continue to be impressed by our team's dedication to our transformational priorities while we continue to navigate the day-to-day performance of the business. We delivered a strong first quarter performance. Net sales were $926 million, an increase of 17% compared to the prior year. This performance was driven by our improved service levels, a continued recovery in the end markets of both of our business segments, and the benefits of recent price increases. Gross profit was $386 million, an increase of $53 million or 16% over the prior year. This improvement was driven by revenue growth and by offsetting the significant increase in material and freight costs through price increases and product and productivity improvements. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 41.7%, a decrease of 30 basis points from 42% in the prior year, a significant achievement given the cost environment. Reported operating profit margin was 12.4% of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 160 basis points over the prior year. Adjusted operating profit margin was 14.4% of net sales, an increase of 120 basis points over the prior year. The majority of this was the result of improved operating leverage as we continued to balance cost management and growth investments. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was 19.6%. In the same period of 2021, the rate was 24.7%. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to favorable discrete items recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 related to excess tax benefits on share-based payments. We expect our tax rate for the full year of 2022 to normalize to around 23% absent these discrete items. Finally, we saw a significant improvement in diluted earnings per share for the quarter of fiscal -- for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Diluted EPS of $2.46 increased $0.89 or 57% over the prior year. And adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.85 increased $0.82 or 40% over the prior year. Our share repurchase program favorably impacted adjusted diluted EPS by $0.07 and the tax impact was approximately $0.16. Moving on to our segments. During the quarter, our Lighting and Lighting Control segment saw sales increase 17% to $884 million versus the prior year. This was driven by improvements within our independent sales network, which grew 14%, and the direct sales network, which grew about 12%. These increases were a direct result of our strong go-to-market efforts and an improved demand environment as well as the favorable impact of price increases. Our corporate accounts channel saw an increase in sales of approximately 62% compared to the prior year, as large accounts began previously deferred maintenance and renovations. The performance in this channel is dependent upon our customers' renovation cycles and can be uneven quarter to quarter. Sales in the retail channel declined approximately 16% in the current quarter. ABL operating profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 30% to $128 million versus the prior year, with operating margin improving 160 basis points to 12.4%. Adjusted operating profit of $138 million improved 28% versus the prior year, with adjusted operating margin improving 140 basis points to 15.6%. Now moving on to the results for our Intelligent Spaces Group. For the first quarter of 2022, sales in spaces increased approximately 14% to $46 million versus the prior year, reflecting continued demand primarily across our building and HVAC controls. Spaces' operating profit in the first quarter of 2022 increased approximately $2 million to $2 million versus the prior year. Adjusted operating profit of $6 million increased approximately $2 million versus the prior year as a result of the strong sales growth. Now turning to cash flow. We continue to generate solid cash flows. The net cash from operating activities for the first three months of fiscal 2022 was $84 million. This was a decrease of $40 million or 32% compared to the prior year and reflects an increased investment in inventory to drive growth. Additionally, cash flow was impacted by the timing of income tax payments and the prior-year deferral of withholding taxes as a result of the CARES Act. We invested $9 million or 1% of net sales in capital expenditures during the first three months of fiscal 2022. During the quarter, we continued to execute on our capital allocation strategy and repurchased approximately 300,000 shares of common stock for around $53 million at an average price of $176 per share. We have approximately 3.5 million shares remaining under our current board authorization. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same. We will continue to prioritize investments for growth in our current businesses, to invest in acquisitions, to maintain our dividend, and to allocate capital to share repurchases when there is an opportunity to create permanent value for our shareholders. I would now like to spend a few minutes addressing current topics of note. First, on the pricing environment. As Neil said, we are managing price aggressively while at the same time balancing the relationships with our customers. We announced another price increase this week effective for orders placed in February. We will continue to be deliberate in our strategic approach to pricing. Next, I would like to update you on the OSRAM integration. We have made significant progress in our integration of OSRAM. We bought the OSRAM North American DS business to ensure control over the technology, to expand our OEM channel and for the benefit it brings through the integration into our supply chain. The addition of OSRAM contributed over 300 basis points to our sales growth in this quarter. There was also a relatively small dilutive impact to gross profit margin, but OSRAM was an overall positive contribution to operating profit. The acquisition is delivering on our expectations and we are very excited that the OSRAM team is now part of Acuity. Finally, you may have noticed that this quarter, we have added an additional metric to our earnings release. We have included EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in our tables of reconciliation to enable easier comparisons and to improve the consistency around reported adjustments. As we continue to navigate 2022, we will continue to prioritize our customers to drive sales growth and operating income. We will also continue to allocate capital in a way that drives long-term growth and that creates permanent value for our shareholders. Thank you for joining us today. I will now pass you over to the operator to take your questions. Operator Thank you. Our first question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Morning, John. John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Maybe first, if we could talk a little bit about the operating profit margin performance. I appreciate the comments in the script. Looks like you were really able to leverage the fixed portion of your SD&A bucket, kind of the non-freight and commissions. Wondering if you could just give a little bit more color there. Is it kind of just the stronger sales flowing through on that? Or are you also driving some productivity on that fixed part of your SD&A cost structure. Thank you. Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Karen, you want me take that? I'll jump in first. So John, yes, thanks for the question. Taking a step back, the plan, as we've said all along, has been to drive sales growth and then to turn that sales growth into operating margin. The first step of that was the product vitality efforts that we did. And now we're -- the second step of that is leveraging the fixed cost. So there's -- I'd say the answer to your question is both. There's obviously improvement because of the larger absolute dollars of sales and a smaller growth in the fixed operating expenses. And within that number, there are and there will continue to be parts of the transformation that provide additional leverage. John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Great. And then I guess just a question on you feel strong about the sales growth going forward. Obviously very early in the year, so kind of not surprised to see no change to the guide. But can you maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of maybe renovation and retrofit demand from energy efficiency and decarb perspective? And then maybe any color on Holophane and if you're seeing any benefit from the passed infrastructure bill yet? And then I'll pass it along. Thank you. Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I'll start. Karen, fill in if I leave anything out. So first, on the financial framework that we provided at the end of the last fiscal year, beginning of this fiscal year. It is our intention to not update that on a regular basis, but to rather provide that framework. And so obviously, you're familiar with that framework. As we look forward to the rest of the year from a sales perspective, obviously, we had a really strong performance this quarter. That was driven by a combination of factors. First, obviously, as I mentioned, the strong end market demand. So demand is strong and continues to be strong, which is leading to, as I indicated, building up a larger amount of lead time in our orders. So we're processing those orders as effectively as we can. That compares to last year, which is normally -- the first quarter, as you know, is a normally lower seasonal quarter, our fiscal first quarter, as well as the generally lower level of demand due to the pandemic at the time. So it's a combination of those factors. As we look forward for the rest of the year, we see sales continue -- we're continuing to process that demand. So as we said, that is our priority, is to satisfy that customer demand. That will mute some of the normal, but not all of the normal, impacts of seasonality so as we look forward. So the second quarter obviously has Christmas and a couple of other things, so it won't be like the first quarter. And then we expect to return to normal levels at some point kind of later this year or early next year. Karen Holcom -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes. The only other thing I would call out, John, is when you look at that corporate accounts channel, it had a really strong quarter at 62% growth year over year. And so that can be inconsistent quarter-to-quarter as well. Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer And then finally, on your question about Holophane and the industrial. Holophane had a good quarter. Candidly, not a great quarter yet. We see lots of opportunity in the future as those projects start to happen. But it's going to take a minute for them to get specced, to get designed and to get funded and to get started. John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Great. Appreciate it. Pass it along. Operator Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel at William Blair. Your line is now open. Ryan Merkel -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst Hey, everyone. Good morning and Happy New Year. Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Good morning. Same to you. Hey, Ryan. Ryan Merkel -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst So Neil, I wanted to start with supply chain, I guess a two-part question. Do you think you're taking market share just based on how well you're managing things? And then secondly, do you feel like the worst is over? Or is it too early to say that? Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer So on your first question, I've said this since I got here. It's frustrating that there isn't more clear information about market so that we could say in absolute terms it's where we are. As you see our performance and then you'll see our competitors' report, I think all indications are that we are taking share. And it's is on the basis of, I really think two key factors, which we've identified, which is product vitality, the investments we've made over time and making sure we have the right products, and then the supply chain, which is really about having the right products in the right place at the right price and at the right time. We, I believe, have performed better than most on that front, which kind of gets to your second question, which is, is the worst of this over? The short answer is we don't know. The -- it's -- we continue to be all surprised, as I indicated in my comments earlier. So no one saw omicron coming. So we don't know if that will impact our labor and therefore our production capacity, for example, over the course of the next several months. But we're working through that. And what I want to highlight is that I believe the dexterity of our supply chain is what has allowed us to perform so well. And by dexterity, I mean we source from multiple places. We have -- on the one hand. But also our team. Our team has been incredibly adaptable. They're reinventing how they source products. They're reinventing how they schedule production. They're reinventing the flow-through through our factory and distribution systems. So we continue to dynamically change these things to make us better. So we're positioning ourselves, Ryan, for uncertainty in the supply chain so that we can continue to perform whether it gets worse or it gets better. And my expectation is that it's going to be this way for a little while longer. Ryan Merkel -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst Got it. Makes sense. And then on price capture, when do you think we'll see the full impact of the price increases that you've put through? And then will the realization be enough to cover your higher costs? Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Karen? Karen Holcom -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Let me start with that, Ryan. As we mentioned in our comments, there is a lag between when we have the price increase and when we see that in the results. And then also the timing of the costs, the costs come in a lot faster than the price does. So as you know, we've now, as of this week, had five price increases. And so you'll start to see benefits of that accumulate throughout the course of the year, while we also expect the cost to increase commensurately throughout the course of the year. So that being said, I think we'll still see some benefit from price and be able to offset cost, but still a bit uncertain and just monitoring what the costs are going to do, and then if we have to take actions in the future to offset some of those. And again, we're not just focused on price. We're also focused on product and productivity improvements to continue to improve our margins. Anything else to add, Neil? Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yes. No. Ryan, I'd just say, strategically, we've been able to get price whenever we've asked for it. And we've made -- as I said in my comments earlier, a -- what I think is an important strategic decision, which is that we're going to honor the prices on orders placed. And that provides a consistency to the end markets who are trying to execute projects. And as Karen mentioned, there's a time lag between when we lock in the pricing on those orders and what the component input costs end up being. But as you can see from the results, it's driving top line and we're turning it into operating profit margin. Ryan Merkel -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst Very helpful. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Jeff Sprague -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst Thank you. Good day, everyone. Two for me. One maybe is just kind of housekeeping. On the comment on the guide that you don't plan to regularly update it, do you plan to though, I guess, reevaluate if you're outside of kind of some band of materiality? Or should we expect that, regardless of what you're printing through the year here, that this framework remains exactly the same? Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Well, so thanks for the question, Jeff. And let me be -- let me give you my view of this philosophically, which is that the reason we use the term framework is because that's what we mean for it to be, which is the framework for how we're thinking about the year. I think it's more important that we provide you how we are thinking about it so that we then collectively can evaluate how we're doing going forward. So that's why we use the term framework as opposed to guidance, and that's why we want to keep it in place. I also will tie you back to what we said at the time, which is that we expected this year to be a higher growth year than our normal expectation for framework. So if you go back to our investor day when we gave you kind of the general perspective of our two segments. And that's philosophically how we want to think about it. We want to have an intelligent and qualitative conversation with you about the outlook and then try and deliver the best results that we can. Jeff Sprague -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst Great. That's helpful, given the whole framework/guidance approach with you. Helpful, but new for all of us given prior practices. So thanks for that insight. Can we come back to kind of the retrofit/reno work? What kind of backlog of activity do you see there? And I understand it might not be in your product backlog per se given the nature of your business and how you book orders. But in terms of kind of feet on the street, people out working projects, do you see that sort of work broadly coming back at this point in time? And any color on how the peak of the season as it relates to that type of activity would be interesting. Karen Holcom -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes. Jeff, this is Karen. We are seeing improvements in several areas related to retrofit and renovation. As we've said before, industrial continues to be a strong market for us. We're seeing improvements -- slight improvements in -- excuse me, office space. Education is strong and depending on the time of the year. So all those markets with renovations continue to be strong. As we said, a lot of the large retailers are coming back and reinvigorating their renovation program, so that's good to see. It's still lagging a bit in markets like hospitality. That seems to be a bit slower to come back than others. So we're seeing that in the orders that we get today. And anecdotally, our agents and our other channels are seeing similar activity in their markets. Jeff Sprague -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst All right. Thanks for the call. Appreciate it. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn at Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Christopher Glynn -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Had a question about IGS. Neil, you mentioned several product expansions into a range of international arenas. I'm curious to hear you talk about the prospects outside North America. Are they different from ABL? Because I think ABL's has been sort of happenstance, not necessarily strategic. You may have some qualifiers, but -- to that. But materially, is there a difference in the international outlook for IGS? Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Thanks, Chris. Great. I appreciate the question and the opportunity to talk about this some more. So before I get into the spaces group, let me spend a second on ABL, which is that North American lighting is different for a number of reasons, between European or Asian lighting, different standards, different electricity, a number -- and different industry structure. So it makes a lot of sense for us to -- in our lighting business to continue to focus on North America and try and continue to take share as we've done. Now switching to the spaces group. When you think about both Distech and the controller and the technology there, it has broader applicability outside of just North America. So the technology there is already present in Europe. We're very strong in France, for example, with Distech. So we see a broader international opportunity for the Distech portion of spaces outside the U.S. as well. And let me spend a second. I talked about Atrius Building Insights earlier. As we're consolidating Atrius and making it the software applications which analyze and then over time provide the ability to take action on data. What that means in this case, Atrius Building Insights allows any facility to understand exactly what their energy costs were, what drove those energy costs and provides them the ability to see that in a consistent way. And so what we've done is now localize that for the European markets that I introduced, which gives us a pathway to continue that European expansion of both Distech and Atrius combined with Distech for the solutions that we envision in the future. Christopher Glynn -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Great. Thanks. And I was curious about the ABL top line framework for high single-digits. Just if we kind of tease out normal seasonality in the next couple of quarters, and I think you indicated second quarter might be on the heavier end of normal seasonality given the first quarter strength. But kind of backs into a flattish fourth quarter to exit the year, I think we'll attribute that to your guidance explanation rather than a ratification of that implication. Is that correct? Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer That's correct. Christopher Glynn -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst OK. Great. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Brian Lee at Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Miguel De Jesus -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Hello. This is Miguel on the line for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. Karen Holcom -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Hi, Miguel. Miguel De Jesus -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Hey. I just wanted to start real quick. On the price increases, you mentioned the fifth price increase announced this week. And then on the four announcements, we were just curious, are all of those -- I guess, is the impact of all of those fully realized in this quarter's results? Or is there still to be left realized on those four prior price increases? Or will those flow through future quarters, along with the fifth one that you just announced? Thanks. Karen Holcom -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes. Thank you, Miguel. As we mentioned, our backlog is meaningfully higher than what we would typically see. So I think in normal times, you might see the price increases come a bit faster. But where we are today, there's still more of the price increases that would come through just in terms of the timing of when they were announced, when they were impacted and then how that backlog will flow through. As we also pointed out, we're not repricing our backlog and adjusting it. So it only reflects the prices that were implemented at the time the order was placed. So you will see a lag in some of the pricing coming through. Miguel De Jesus -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst OK. Great. Thanks. And then I had just a quick follow-up, too. It doesn't sound like it, but how are customers, I guess, responding to price increases? You mentioned that you built in a lag for when you announced the prices. And then I think in a prior call, you mentioned that there's a possibility there have been some demand pull-forward as customers maybe anticipate further price increases. But do you see any possibility of maybe a decline in customer orders if prices go up to a certain level, given if material costs and things maybe go up higher than expected? Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer I'll take that one. So first of all, no one likes higher prices. We don't like them, our customers don't like them. But everyone recognizes that this is a time where all costs are changing, and therefore, prices are -- there's a general expectation that prices are going to go up. So our end markets are, as I mentioned earlier, are taking all of the price increases that we are putting forward. Part of the -- but let me spend a second on the strategy of price, which is -- and a couple of important components to that. The first is that we're trying to be prudent and strategic about our pricing because we believe that, at the end of the day, it will come back to we need to have the right product, which is product vitality; in the right place, which is effective service levels; at the right price. And so we're -- part of the investment we're making in honoring our -- the prices of our orders is the investment in that relationship with our customers and the end markets so that they can see that, they can expect and plan their projects accordingly. So are input price is going to change and will that potentially have an impact on prices over time? Of course, they will. And they could go in either direction. But our strategy is to have the right product in the right place at the right price. And we are demonstrating that, that strategy is driving growth, which we think is in excess of the market, and we're leveraging our cost to expand margins at the same time. Miguel De Jesus -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst I appreciate that. And I just had one more, if I could squeeze in a real quick. It's on OSRAM. You mentioned just now a 300 basis point sales -- a 300 basis point contribution to this quarter's kind of results. I think in the past, you mentioned that, over the course of fiscal '22, it would be at 200 basis points contribution to the top line. So are you still tracking to that 200 basis point sort of framework? Or maybe are you seeing signs that that's starting to accelerate? Karen Holcom -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes. Let me take that one. For OSRAM, as we said, this quarter is the 300 basis points. And the acquisition is going really well, it's on track, and we're really pleased to have that as part of our product portfolio and our capability. What I would say is that, just remember, we did buy it toward the end of the year. So we have two months of it in our results, so you will see, I would kind of say 300 basis points is a reasonable amount to assume for the first few quarters. But then toward the back end, it will tail off a bit since we did own it in the fourth quarter. Miguel De Jesus -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst OK. That makes sense. I'll pass it on. Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from Chris Snyder at UBS. Your line is now open. Chris Snyder -- UBS -- Analyst Thank you. I want to follow up on the ABL high single-digit growth commentary. And I understand that this is more of a framework than maybe hard guidance. But with M&A adding 300 to 400 bps of growth and the company up low teens organically in the first quarter, the guidance embeds kind of low single-digit organic growth the rest of the year if my math is correct. And which seems highly unlikely, given elevated backlogs and improving nonres activity. Are there headwinds here that we should be watching out for? Karen Holcom -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Chris, as Neil said, it's a framework, and that was the framework that we gave kind of as we started the year. This year, we have seen abnormally high growth that is not reflective of what we've seen in the past. And you see that in the 16% or 17% sales growth this year. So I think your math, you understand the math part of the equation, and we just want to give you the framework and kind of the paint by numbers to look at for the year. The first half of the year, I would say, was a low comparison to prior year. So you are seeing a bit of that. And then -- and so I would say it's a framework, and we don't intend to update that. Neil, anything you wanted to add? Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer No. Nothing to add. Chris Snyder -- UBS -- Analyst Thank you for that. And then for the follow-up, as we think about the gross margin cadence and achieving the full year guidance of 42% plus, is it fair to assume that Q2 steps down before a back half recovery? And is the latest price increase needed to get back above 42% in the back half? Or should we view this maybe more as a cushion? Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer So Chris, let me reiterate what I've said multiple times so far on this call. First, our framework is a framework that we provided at the beginning of the year, and we don't intend to update on a regular basis. Second, we're doing everything we can to deliver the highest possible results that are consistent with our investment and long-term growth and transformation of the company. Third, we've grown sales growth, and we've turned that into operating profit margin. So we've demonstrated that we are both taking share, we are getting price, and we're effectively managing the supply chain to deliver on that operating profit and sales growth. Chris Snyder -- UBS -- Analyst Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea at Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Joe O'Dea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Good morning, everyone. First question is just on the operating environment. And if you could talk about what you've seen unfold since you last reported and the degree to which you've seen stabilization. And anything that you can call out that's changing either better or worse? And maybe relate that to the most recently announced price increase, whether what you saw three months ago kind of gave you indications that you're going to be taking price up again, or whether you've seen things that required more pricing action? Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Thanks for the question, Joe, and I appreciate you picking up coverage. As we're -- the tree top view is that we continue to see really strong demand, as we said, and we've been really dynamic in the management of supply chain based on availability and access to the necessary inputs to manufacture each of the products. And so it was our expectation and when we laid out the framework and we talked to you last, that this was going to be a dynamic environment. We've been kind of continuing to talk about that. That prices are changing on a regular basis, and therefore, probably our prices are going to change as well. So we're not surprised by, obviously, the fact that prices have increased. And maybe we can provide some anecdotes to give an indication of kind of what we're talking about. So when you think about kind of the inputs, obviously, we're talking about chips, we're talking about steel, we're talking about aluminum, we're talking about resin. And we're talking about things like transportation. And one of the kind of interesting examples is that our normal transportation time from -- for the components and the finished goods that we source in Asia, is normally around, say, 20 days of time on the water. That's approaching almost 60 days at this point. So that has an impact on -- that timing has an impact on cost, obviously. That timing has an impact on inventory. That timing has an impact on a number of things. And that's just one anecdote and one example of how we're combating this. So the answer to your question is yes, we expect prices to -- we expect costs to change over the course of the year, and we expect prices to continue to change over the course of the year. Joe O'Dea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst I appreciate the color. And then a second question just related to cash and deployment and how we should be thinking about free cash flow conversion on adjusted net income this year, given some of the inventory build, whether you think that inventory cushion is comfortable at this point. But then when we think about the current cash levels and the ongoing kind of cash generation, what your appetite is for buybacks at this point versus a preference to be patient on deals. Karen Holcom -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes. Hi. This is Karen. First, I wanted to reiterate our capital allocation priorities. As we've said before, our first priority is to invest in the growth of our current businesses. The second is to invest in M&A. The third is to maintain our dividend. And then fourth, we will do share repurchases when we believe there's an opportunity to create permanent value for our shareholders. So if you look at kind of those four priorities and start with the first and your comment on inventory, let me just make a few points on inventory. Really, inventory is up for about three reasons, three key reasons. One, to support the increased demand that we're seeing in the environment that we've talked a lot about today. Second is to secure supply when there is availability. So when we see the opportunity to buy components and secure supply for future orders, given the shortages, we are certainly doing that. And then third goes to what Neil just referenced with some of the longer lead times on products that are on the water that's already our inventory. So we are investing in inventory for the growth of the business. So those are our priorities. We'll continue to focus on those. And then to answer your direct question about share repurchases, as we see value to create -- that opportunity to create value for shareholders, we will do so. Joe O'Dea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Got it. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Osborne at Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Jeff Osborne -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Great. Good morning. Two questions on my end. One, Karen, I was wondering if you could just remind us on what the typical lag is from order to revenue recognition. And you mentioned that, that is stretching out. But can you just put it in perspective what that is in normalized times and what it is today? Karen Holcom -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes. Typically, we would have seen, it depends on the projects, but you would have not seen elevated backlog like we're seeing today. So it could be a few weeks, it could be a few months. But just based on kind of the availability of the components, the supply chain challenges that we've discussed with the lead times, it is stretching beyond that. So it can be upwards of six months or so. But these are all placed orders. They're not speculative orders. It's really just the timing of when we can ship the orders. Jeff Osborne -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe for Neil. 18, 24 months in now, can you just give us a sense of the UVC product line? You haven't mentioned it in recent earnings calls, but has that been successful? Or any update on the product momentum and availability would be helpful. Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Thanks for that. As we said, we built a -- we have built a robust product line now for GUV on the expectation that people will buy it consistently. We've seen some traction with larger individual accounts that recognize the value of kind of the investment. But I would not say, as I said, to kind of several quarters ago, we don't view this as a game-changer for us. But it's a -- but rather as an adaptation to a market environment. We'll see. I think the -- with every additional variant, it becomes more clear that we're going to have to collectively make longer-term investments in keeping spaces safer. And we've got the best portfolio of GUV products to do that. So to the extent the market comes our way, I think we're well positioned. But the market isn't as large as I think some had hoped it would be. Jeff Osborne -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Tim Wojs at Baird. Your line is now open. Tim Wojs -- Baird -- Analyst Hey. Good morning, everybody. Nice nice work on the quarter. Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Tim. Tim Wojs -- Baird -- Analyst Maybe just the first one, I just want to kind of run back to seasonality. Q2 is kind of typically your weakest quarter from just a gross margin perspective just kind of structurally. And I think normally, it's down 50 to 100 basis points from Q1 levels. And so I know you don't want to necessarily give quarterly guidance, but just given how tough the comp is last year, would you expect kind of a similar kind of seasonal trend to play out this year, kind of Q1 to Q2? I just want to make sure we have that calibrated correctly. Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Tim, are you talking about on a year-on-year basis or a sequential basis? Tim Wojs -- Baird -- Analyst Sequential. Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer So let me address the -- obviously, we had a blowout margin -- gross margin quarter and last year. And we've talked extensively about kind of what's changed between then and now and why. So as we look at the -- sequentially from fiscal first quarter to second, first quarter and address the seasonality. So obviously, in the second quarter, we have Christmas, we have New Years. We have a lot of impacts which makes top line lower in the second quarter than the first quarter, which naturally will depress gross margin on a sequential basis because of the leveraging of the fixed cost in our supply chain. So that's the kind of the general outline. And as we've said, we're -- as I've said and Karen reiterated, now we're really trying to work through -- we're prioritizing this customer demand. And I gave a framework for how we're doing that, which will ultimately lead to what kind of gross margin is. Tim Wojs -- Baird -- Analyst OK. OK. So it sounds like more seasonal than last year would maybe be the framework to say. OK. And then I guess, maybe just like big picture, when you think about the environment in terms of quoting projects and how those customers think about lighting in general. I mean, there has been a lot of deflation in the market over the last four years, and that's clearly flipped to inflation now. I mean, do you think this phenomenon around how people are kind of thinking about lighting and kind of speccing that in and pricing is kind of a cyclical benefit right now? Or do you think there's the potential that there's kind of a mindset change in terms of how people are thinking about lighting on a go-forward basis? I don't know if that makes sense, but hopefully, I'm just trying to understand, like, if there's kind of a conceptual difference in terms of how the end customer is thinking about lighting today than maybe four or five years ago. Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yes. I mean, I think the -- I think we're going to be anecdotal as opposed to kind of philosophical, I think, at this point, Tim, because I think the market has changed so fast that people are responding to where it is right now. I will say on the kind of the opportunity for this to be a longer-term phenomenon as it relates to us, specifically, the product vitality, the quality of product, the breadth of product and the impact of that product in the marketplace is a game-changer. I emphasized the Compact Pro High Bay in the past, which is a game-changer from a value and impact perspective. The STACK that I referenced today is changing how the end market can interact with our product, which changes the general value chain for the market because it costs less to install, it has more flexibility. So those things are permanent increases which are permanent value changes. And so we're accessing other areas of value that we can deliver, and we're participating in that. So if, for example, you use a lot less labor to install, then there's a lot less pressure on the value of the luminaire or the control solution. So that's -- kind of strategically, that's why we pushed the product quality. We've also pushed it on the products, as I said, around the right product in the right place at the right price so that we can be consistent and deliver on those high service levels. I also think that will continue. So I think the -- will the general inflationary environment continue broadly? I think that's up for debate. And as I've said in the past, CEOs are generally terrible economists. So I wouldn't believe what I had to say about that anyway. But I do think that the changes that we're making specific to us are positioning us well for both this period and the periods that follow. Tim Wojs -- Baird -- Analyst OK. OK. Great. That's helpful. So thanks. Thanks for the time and good luck on the recipe. Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Tim. Tim Wojs -- Baird -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Neil Ashe for any closing remarks. Neil Ashe -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Before we break, I wanted to thank all of you for joining us and again reiterate a Happy New Year. I want to bear attention to the publication of our 2021 EarthLIGHT report. We've made substantial progress on our ESG strategy in 2021. And I'm really pleased to say these efforts are being recognized. In December, the Carbon Disclosure Project vastly improved our rating over prior periods. It's a testament to the team for prioritizing and driving our ESG initiatives. We're really pleased with where we are. We're really pleased with where we're going, and we appreciate you investing both your time and your capital in Acuity Brands.

A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is included at the end of this press release. Financial Results for Fiscal Q2 Ended December 31, 2024 AOS Chief Executive Officer Stephen Chang commented, \u201cOur fiscal Q2 results were in-line with our revenue and EPS guidance driven by seasonal declines in each of our major segments. We saw strength in Communications and Industrial segments, with notable sequential growth in graphics cards, quick chargers, PC desktops and power tools.\u201d Mr. Chang concluded, \u201cWe expect a typical seasonal decline in the March quarter primarily in markets for battery PCM in smartphones and quick chargers. While visibility is limited for the remainder of calendar year 2025, we are well positioned for growth driven by our strategic focus to \u2018go deeper\u2019 with total solutions, expanding our addressable markets and achieving higher BOM content and market share.\u201d Business Outlook for Fiscal Q3 Ending March 31, 2025 The following statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. AOS undertakes no obligation to update these statements. Our expectations for the fiscal third quarter of year 2025 are as follows: Conference Call and Webcast AOS plans to hold an investor teleconference and live webcast to discuss the financial results for the fiscal second quarter ended December 31, 2024 today, February 5, 2025 at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET.

In addition, a copy of the script of management\u2019s prepared remarks and a live webcast of the call will also be available in the \"Events & Presentations\" section of the company\u2019s investor relations website, http://investor.aosmd.com. Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections of future performance based on management\u2019s judgment, beliefs, current trends, and anticipated product performance. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, market trends in the semiconductor industry and growth in calendar year 2025, our ability to outperform market, seasonality of our business, our ability to pursue new opportunities, our projected amount of revenue, gross margin, operating income (loss), income tax expenses, net income (loss), and share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax expenses, our ability to grow our sales and market share, and other information under the section entitled \u201cBusiness Outlook for Fiscal Q3 Ending March 31, 2025.\u201d Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, the state of semiconductor industry and seasonality of our markets; decline of PC markets; our lack of control over the joint venture in China; difficulties and challenges in executing our diversification strategy into different market segments; ordering pattern from distributors and seasonality; changes in regulatory environment and government investigation; our ability to introduce or develop new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance; government policies on our business operations in China; the actual product performance in volume production; the quality and reliability of our product, our ability to achieve design wins; the general business and economic conditions; our ability to maintain factory utilization at a desirable level; and other risks as described in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 filed by AOS with the SEC and other periodic reports we filed with the SEC. Other unknown or unpredictable factors or underlying assumptions subsequently proving to be incorrect could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance, or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. All information provided in this press release is as of today\u2019s date, unless otherwise stated, and AOS undertakes no duty to update such information, except as required under applicable law. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements presented on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures for our historical performance, including non-GAAP gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income (loss), net income (loss), diluted earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) and EBITDAS. These supplemental measures exclude, among other items, share-based compensation expenses, legal and professional fees related to government investigation, amortization of purchased intangible, income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and equity method investment loss from equity investee. We also disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures in our guidance for the next quarter, including non-GAAP gross margin and operating expenses. We believe that these historical and forecast non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain items and expenses that are not indicative of our core operating results or do not reflect our normal business operations. In addition, our management uses non-GAAP measures to compare our performance relative to forecasts and to benchmark our performance externally against competitors. Our use of non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations in that such non-GAAP financial measures may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. For example, the terms used in this press release, such as non-GAAP net income (loss) or non-GAAP operating expenses, do not have a standardized meaning. Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of our performance in relation to other companies. In addition, we included the amount of income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments in the non-GAAP net income (loss) of reconciliation table for all periods presented as the management believes that such non-GAAP presentation provides useful information to investors, even though the amounts are not significant. We seek to compensate for the limitation of our non-GAAP presentation by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures both in the text in this press release and in the tables attached hereto. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.

A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is included at the end of this press release. Financial Results for Fiscal Q1 Ended September 30, 2024 AOS Chief Executive Officer Stephen Chang commented, \u201cOur fiscal Q1 results were in-line with our revenue and EPS guidance driven by sequential growth in each of our major segments. We saw seasonal strength from smartphones, computing, tablets, gaming, and wearables.\" Mr. Chang concluded, \u201cLooking into the rest of calendar year 2024, we anticipate a typical seasonal decline in notebooks and smartphones that will lead to a sequential decrease in December quarter revenue. However, we expect slight sequential growth in our Computing and Industrial segments\u2014driven by strength in desktops, graphics cards, and quick chargers\u2014to help partially offset this decline. Looking into next year, although visibility is limited, our strategic transition from a component supplier to a total solutions provider with a diverse product portfolio and premier customer base positions us well to outperform the broader markets we serve.\" Business Outlook for Fiscal Q2 Ending December 31, 2024 The following statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. AOS undertakes no obligation to update these statements. Our expectations for the fiscal second quarter of year 2025 are as follows: Conference Call and Webcast AOS plans to hold an investor teleconference and live webcast to discuss the financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2024 today, November 4, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections of future performance based on management\u2019s judgment, beliefs, current trends, and anticipated product performance. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, market trends in the semiconductor industry and growth in calendar year 2024, our ability to outperform market, seasonality of our business, our ability to pursue new opportunities, our projected amount of revenue, gross margin, operating income (loss), income tax expenses, net income (loss), and share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax expenses, our ability to grow our sales and market share, and other information under the section entitled \u201cBusiness Outlook for Fiscal Q2 Ending December 31, 2024.\u201d Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, the state of semiconductor industry and seasonality of our markets; decline of PC markets; our lack of control over the joint venture in China; difficulties and challenges in executing our diversification strategy into different market segments; ordering pattern from distributors and seasonality; changes in regulatory environment and government investigation; our ability to introduce or develop new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance; government policies on our business operations in China; the actual product performance in volume production; the quality and reliability of our product, our ability to achieve design wins; the general business and economic conditions; our ability to maintain factory utilization at a desirable level; and other risks as described in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 filed by AOS with the SEC and other periodic reports we filed with the SEC. Other unknown or unpredictable factors or underlying assumptions subsequently proving to be incorrect could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance, or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. All information provided in this press release is as of today\u2019s date, unless otherwise stated, and AOS undertakes no duty to update such information, except as required under applicable law. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements presented on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures for our historical performance, including non-GAAP gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income (loss), net income (loss), diluted earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) and EBITDAS. These supplemental measures exclude, among other items, share-based compensation expenses, legal and professional fees related to government investigation, amortization of purchased intangible, income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and equity method investment loss from equity investee. We also disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures in our guidance for the next quarter, including non-GAAP gross margin and operating expenses. We believe that these historical and forecast non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain items and expenses that are not indicative of our core operating results or do not reflect our normal business operations. In addition, our management uses non-GAAP measures to compare our performance relative to forecasts and to benchmark our performance externally against competitors. Our use of non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations in that such non-GAAP financial measures may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. For example, the terms used in this press release, such as non-GAAP net income (loss) or non-GAAP operating expenses, do not have a standardized meaning. Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of our performance in relation to other companies. In addition, we included the amount of income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments in the non-GAAP net income (loss) of reconciliation table for all periods presented as the management believes that such non-GAAP presentation provides useful information to investors, even though the amounts are not significant. We seek to compensate for the limitation of our non-GAAP presentation by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures both in the text in this press release and in the tables attached hereto. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.

As we stated last quarter, we are approaching the recovery phase of the next cycle. While that trajectory is hard to predict, we are coming out of the downturn an even stronger and more resilient company. Looking beyond 2024 to the growth phase of the next cycle, AOS is transitioning from a component supplier to become a comprehensive solution provider, enabling us to go deeper with increasing BOM content and penetrating new products and verticals. Guidance: Now, I would like to discuss June quarter guidance. We expect revenue to be approximately $160 million plus or minus $10 million Note 2) Guidance suggests no to low growth Y/Y. Here are a couple of Scouting Reports: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4704476-alpha-and-omega-semiconductor-what-is-driving-the-rally-higher#source=section%3Asummary|section_asset%3Aall_analysis|first_level_url%3Asymbol|button%3ATitle|lock_status%3ANo|line%3A1 https://seekingalpha.com/article/4684988-alpha-omega-semiconductor-speculative-shot-at-this-level-despite-risk#source=section%3Asummary|section_asset%3Aall_analysis|first_level_url%3Asymbol|button%3ATitle|lock_status%3ANo|line%3A2 From my viewpoint I see no reason to add AOSL to the roster - and - even if I did it would be a small Development Squad position. Having said that - some people that I think exceptionally highly of have established positions in the company. Moreover - since I am a Complete Tech Moron (CTM) I simply don\u2019t see it. To be fair - I also didn\u2019t see it when AOSL was gaining 72% YTD. See how this works? At $40 or below I might take a small DS position based solely on momentum: as well as, faith and trust in the folks much more tech savvy and smarter than me - which, I admit is a rather large club.

Yifan Liang -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, So-Yeon. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Revenue for the September quarter was $117.8 million, up 5.3% when compared to the prior quarter and up 2.4% from the same quarter last year. In terms of product mix, MOSFET revenue was $100.6 million, up 4.3% sequentially and up 9% year over year. Power IC revenue was $15.7 million, up 14.1% from the prior quarter and down 19% from a year ago. Assembly service revenue was $1.5 million as compared to $1.7 million for the prior quarter and $3.4 million for the same quarter last year. Regarding the segment mix, computing represented 39.2% of the total revenue; Consumer, 18.2%; power supply and industrial 23.2%; communications, 18.1%; and service, 1.3%. Non-GAAP gross margin for the September quarter was 28.3% as compared to 27.4% for the prior quarter and 29.7% for the same quarter last year. The quarter-over-quarter increase in non-GAAP gross margin was mainly driven by the improvement of operation efficiency and product mix, partially offset by price erosion. Non-GAAP gross margin excluded $0.4 million of share-based compensation charge for the September quarter as compared to $0.4 million for the prior quarter and $0.5 million for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin also excluded $6 million of production ramp-up costs related to the Chongqing joint venture for the September quarter as compared to $2.6 million for the prior quarter and $1.1 million for the same quarter last year. As the JV company's 12-inch fabs started production in July 2019, all fab-related costs were moved from G&A to cost of goods sold for the September quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the September quarter were $25.6 million, compared to $22.6 million for the prior quarter and $24.5 million for the same quarter last year. The quarter-over-quarter increase in non-GAAP operating expenses was primarily due to the increase in R&D engineering expenses and our annual merit increase started in the new fiscal year. Non-GAAP operating expenses excluded $1.9 million of share-based compensation charge as compared to $2.1 million for the prior quarter and $2.6 million for the same quarter last year. Both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses included $2.8 million of digital power controller team expenses for the quarter as compared to $2.3 million for the prior quarter and $2.7 million for the same quarter last year. Our digital power controller team continues to engage with customers in product designs and is making steady progress toward our product road map. Income tax expense for the quarter was $0.4 million as compared to income tax benefits of $0.6 million for the prior quarter and income tax expense of $0.6 million for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP EPS attributable to AOS for the quarter was $0.26 per share as compared to $0.35 for the prior quarter and $0.36 for the same quarter last year. Historically, AOS has been generating positive operating cash flow. However, in the September quarter, net cash used in operating activities by AOS was $4.2 million. This was largely impacted by two items totaling $15.1 million. First, $9.2 million one-day delay of receivable payment from one of our major distributors due to the bank shutdown on September 30, 2019, because of Typhoon Mitag in Taiwan. Second, $5.9 million net intercompany receivable impact from the JV company. For the prior quarter, AOS generated $15.2 million operating cash flow and $18.4 million for the September quarter last year. The JV company generated $1.6 million operating cash flow in the September quarter, compared to $6.9 million used in operating activities for the prior quarter and $0.4 million for the same quarter last year. The $1.6 million operating cash flow was largely attributable to the $5.9 million intercompany payable to AOS and a $2.7 million interest refund received from the local government under the joint venture agreement. This refund program will continue for the next two years at the same amount each year. Consolidated EBITDAS for the September quarter was $14.3 million, compared to $14.2 million for the prior quarter and $15.4 million for the same quarter last year. EBITDAS attributable to AOS for the quarter was $13.8 million as compared to $15.1 million for the prior quarter and $16.7 million for the same quarter last year. Now let's look at the balance sheet. We completed the September quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $103.1 million, including $88 million at AOS and $15.1 million at the joint venture. This compares to $121.9 million at the end of last quarter, which included $100.7 million at AOS and $21.2 million at the JV company. Our cash balance a year ago was $113.2 million, including $81.2 million at AOS and $32 million at the JV company. Bank borrowing balance at the end of the September quarter was $136.4 million, including $41 million at AOS and $95.4 million at the JV company. In the September quarter, AOS borrowed $2 million from a new line and paid back $2.1 million of the existing loans. The JV company borrowed $0.8 million from a new working capital line and paid back $1.7 million of the existing loans. Net trade receivables were $39.3 million as compared to $24.3 million at the end of last quarter and $37.1 million for the same quarter last year. Days sales outstanding for the quarter was 25 days, compared to 24 days in the prior quarter. Net inventory was $118.6 million at the quarter-end, up from $111.6 million last quarter and from $98 million in the prior year. Average days in inventory came down to 114 days for the quarter as compared to 117 days in the prior quarter. Net property, plant and equipment was $400.3 million as compared to $409.7 million last quarter and $368.5 million last year. Capital expenditures were $14.4 million for the quarter, including $8.3 million at AOS and $6.1 million at the JV company. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I would like to share the progress at our JV company. During the September quarter, assembly and test production continued to ramp up and the 12-inch fab started small mass production in July 2019. We expect to continue to ramp up Phase 1 of the 12-inch fab in accordance with our plan to approach the target run rate by the September quarter of calendar-year 2020. With that, now I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Dr. Mike Chang, who will provide the business highlights for the quarter. Mike? Mike Chang -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Yifan. Good afternoon. We are pleased with our performance and financial results in the September quarter. AOS achieved a record quarterly revenue of $117.8 million, marking the 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. The strong top-line performance was driven in part by the additional supply contribution from the 12-inch fab at the JV company. Gross margin came in higher than midpoint of our guidance, which was more than enough to offset the investment in R&D and delivered healthy earnings for the quarter. One of the major growth drivers for us is mobile applications, such as smartphone, battery protection and quick chargers. I will take a few minutes to share with you the exciting progress we are seeing in this business. It always starts with strategy. As a relatively young company, we identify applications that give us a head start with our core technology, as well as the volume to scale. Once we land, we expand our footprint with multidimensional initiatives, including share gain, content increase and customer expansion to become a market leader. We then use this success as a springboard to leap to the next market and replicate the success. We have demonstrated our ability to execute this strategy in the computing market, where we grew from zero dollars to about $200 million in annual revenue. We plan to do the same in the mobile market, where the served available market opportunity is more than double that of the computing market. We have successfully landed at each of the seven largest smartphone OEMs worldwide as one of their key suppliers. Our mobile business combining battery protection and quick charger products is growing significantly. In the September quarter, we doubled mobile business revenue from the same quarter last year. Now that we are aligned with top-tier global brand OEMs and ODMs, we will continue to focus on expanding our presence to multiple generations smartphone models and the peripheral devices. As a case in point, last year, we initially penetrated into a global brand OEM with a one-year model as a new supplier. This year, we won new models on top of the last year's model and further penetrated into several adjacent sockets. We plan to grow our share by adding additional days of business year after year at the multiple global OEMs and ODMs. The JV company is expected to play a vital role as a reliable and scalable supply chain for many years to come. In the meantime, to support the current demand for our mobile products for this year's models, we are diligently working to make room at the Oregon fab by transferring production of some of our products to the JV company. Typically, transfer activity takes approximately six to nine months depending upon the complexity of applications, as well as the number of OEMs and ODMs involved. Generally speaking, transferring products for applications with short cycles such as PC is relatively faster with a simpler requalification process. We have already started the requalification process for some computing products and are making steady progress. Given that the market is less tight and the macro environment is uncertain, the requalification process is returning to a normalized pace rather than the accelerated pace we experienced last year. Nonetheless, we expect this transfer activity to still help us buck the seasonality with slight growth in the December quarter following the record-high September quarter. The products manufactured at the JV company are already in customers' hands for qualification, and design-in momentum for these products is building. We are confident in our ability to reach the Phase 1 target run rate by the September quarter next year, as we discussed on our last earnings call. In addition to the mobile business, we are also encouraged by healthy demand across our product lines. As the computing industry expands to include artificial intelligence, big data and Internet of Things, our customers increasingly value our highly efficient and high-performance products, especially for the Vcore and system power. Our IGBT solutions also contribute -- also continue to establish strong footing at a broad base of home appliance customers. We also see solid demand for our products for AC-DC power supplies. Notably, the Oregon fab has been running at its full capacity and some products built there are still on allocation. Despite macro headwinds and growing market uncertainty, we are generating positive results by executing our prudent business strategy. Our diversified products are well-positioned with strategic players in multiple key market segments. We are committed to even better serving those customers through increasingly sophisticated total solutions and a reliable supply chain. We are encouraged by the tremendous growth opportunities ahead of us, which give us confidence in achieving our calendar-year 2021 target of $600 million of annual revenue. With this solid start in the first quarter, we will continue to execute on our growth strategy and build strong momentum in our business in fiscal-year 2020 and onward. Now I will turn the call over to Stephen for a detailed segment report. Stephen? Stephen Chang -- Executive Vice President Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon. Let me start with computing. It represented 39.2% of our total revenue in the September quarter. Revenue was down 6.1% sequentially and down 8.3% year over year. As planned, we served our computing customers in the peak season utilizing channel inventories on hand. Computing sell-through grew by double digits sequentially to reach a record high. Our Vcore business is strong, and we see some early adopters of the system power products built at the Chongqing JV. While the CPU supply constraint is easing, it is expected to remain challenging in the December quarter. Based on that, we are estimating conservatively a modest increase for the December quarter. Now let's discuss the consumer segment, which represented 18.2% of total revenue in the September quarter. Revenue increased 2.5% sequentially and was up 0.6% year over year. The sequential growth was driven mainly by IGBT products in home appliances in China and Korea. We continue to grow our business in refrigerators and air conditioning systems as our IGBT products provide our customers with the performance and reliability demanded by these applications. We are on track to achieve another 40% growth with our IGBT product line this calendar year, the second year in a row at that level. Going into the low season, although home appliances will grow slightly, it is not expected to be sufficient to offset a seasonal decline in TVs. We expect a double-digit decline in the consumer segment for the December quarter. Now let's turn to the power supply and industrial segment. This segment accounted for 23.2% of total revenue, up 19.1% sequentially and up 25.4% year over year. Our quick charger momentum accelerated during the September quarter. We again achieved a double-digit growth from the strong June quarter because of our strategic position at global smartphone OEMs in their peak season. We also saw a rebound in our AC-DC power supply business during the September quarter. Looking into the December quarter, the quick charger business was slow as we exit the smartphone season. However, we expect to maintain overall segment revenue at the September-quarter level due to growth from other applications. Finally, let's discuss the communications segment, which was 18.1% of revenue in the quarter, up 24.6% sequentially and up 19.2% year over year. Rising demand for our battery protection products resulted in substantial growth in this segment in the peak smartphone season. Our products are based on our leading low voltage MOSFET technology, which enables higher efficiency and cooler operation during battery charging and discharging. We saw some softness in the 5G telecom business during the September quarter in the midst of trade tensions. Looking to the December quarter, we expect the battery protection business to decline slightly. This will be offset by some recovery of our 5G telecom business. Therefore, we expect to maintain this segment's revenue in the December quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Yifan for the guidance. Yifan Liang -- Chief Financial Officer As we look forward to the second quarter of fiscal-year 2020, we expect revenue to be between $117 million and $121 million, GAAP gross margin to be 22.3% plus or minus 1%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 27.3% plus or minus 1%. Note that non-GAAP gross margin excludes $0.4 million of estimated share-based compensation and $5.8 million of estimated production ramp-up costs relating to the JV company. GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $27.4 million plus or minus $1 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $25.4 million plus or minus $1 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses include $3.1 million to $3.3 million of estimated expenses relating to the development of our digital power controller business. Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude an estimated share-based compensation charge of approximately $2 million. Tax expense to be approximately $0.5 million or $0.7 million. Loss attributable to non-controlling interest to be around $3.6 million. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding estimated production ramp-up costs relating to the JV company. This item is expected to be approximately $0.9 million. As part of our normal practice, we're not assuming any obligations to update this information. With that, we'll open up the floor to four questions. Operator? Operator [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from David Williams with Loop Capital. David Williams -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst Hey, thanks, and thanks for allowing me to ask a question. Congrats on the quarter and the progress being made. First, from a design win perspective, just kind of getting -- trying to gauge the customer level and interest, what are you seeing in terms of design activity and in terms of projects kicking off? Are you seeing any delays there or maybe some acceleration? I know in the past, you talked about some delays and push out of certain projects. Are you still seeing that? Or are you seeing customers maybe a little more willing to go and step in and kick these projects off? Stephen Chang -- Executive Vice President Sure. This is Stephen. Good question. So our design win is very healthy. For '20, I would expect, yes, in the March quarter, probably in line with the current level in the June quarter, I would expect an increase. At that time, we'll have more activities for the R&D design-ins or wins for the following year. Greg Ellis -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst OK. My last clarification, and it's a follow-up to the earlier question. I know three months ago, we were worried about distributor channel inventory, particularly in the PC space, and distributor intent to get inventory levels down. I know you talked about inventory levels overall, but are you also saying that within that, you're happy that -- with PC inventories -- the PC inventories are at normal levels? Yifan Liang -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. And last couple of quarters, actually, we managed that dynamic between our internal inventory, external inventory and our own productions. So we knew in the September quarter we would have computing and mobile businesses will be in the peak season. So with our limited -- constrained capacity, we're managing those dynamics so that we use our channel inventory to support our September quarter's PC peak season. So that's why from the real business perspective, our sell-through PC revenue actually reached a record high in the September quarter. So just we spare more capacity to support the mobile side of the business growth. Greg Ellis -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst OK. And congratulations on the record sell-throughs with compute. I'll use that as a segue to ask Stephen in a few questions, Stephen, just on the Communications business, can you help us understand, one, the degree to which the wins that the company is getting is for 4G phones versus 5G? And given the very significant increase in expectations for 5G phones next year, which I think consensus is probably around 250 million units, how does the company feel about its ability to get designed-in into those phones since that's where a lot of the interesting growth is going to be coming from in calendar '20? Stephen Chang -- Executive Vice President Sure, Craig. So in general, the higher the power, the higher the battery that's needed, the more power content is and there is for AOS. With the advent of 5G, and we're anticipating that the usage will go up as more video streaming and there's more demands on the battery, whether you're charging or discharging. So for us, we're happy to see a push for greater performance out of the power products. So for us, we believe that this could be -- continue to be a growth area for us as battery capacities are increasing and as the MOS that's basically have to be more efficient. Greg Ellis -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst Does that mean you think that a majority of your design wins are 5G? Or just that a majority of your design wins are at the very high end of the performance continuum for the seven smartphone OEMs that you and Mike had mentioned? Stephen Chang -- Executive Vice President We don't really split it out that way. In general, we -- the high-performance ones are the higher-end smartphones. And if 5G is one of the trends that's pushing for the higher battery, it's not the only trend that's pushing for the bigger capacities and the higher power consumption. To us, it's a bit of a spectrum in terms of the demand on the phones themselves. Greg Ellis -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst OK. And then lastly, in the communications space, before I flip it over to Mike. I think, right now, just given the significant baseband release activity out of Asian players, there's a forming view that the first calendar quarter or your fiscal 3Q and potentially even fiscal 4Q could be above seasonal as a lot of the 5G OEMs -- 5G smartphone models launch from China OEMs and others. What's your sense for the strength in the Communications business beyond the current quarter? Is there a potential for the business to be flat in the first quarter, potentially even grow given what we're seeing with new model launch activity around the corner? Stephen Chang -- Executive Vice President Generally, smartphone, again, the peak is in this September quarter. Definitely, I think we're seeing more models of kind of filling in the gap between the peaks. But in general, I don't think that will be big enough to offset the normal seasonal pattern for phones. The major vendors still tend to be releasing around that September time frame. Greg Ellis -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst OK, got it. One for Mike, and then I'll ask my final. Mike, it's helpful to get your perspective on land-and-expand in the strategy the company is deploying, and certainly, there are some encouraging signs of success in communications. My question is this, as you look at the penetration rate and adoption capacity of the seven different OEMs, in a better case environment, if all OEMs were to march at the pace of some of your best adopters within that group, how big can communications be in a year or two years from now? If it's 18% of sales now, does it have the opportunity to get into the mid-20s in 12 months and maybe even toward 30%, longer term? Or what are we looking at if things really hit with land-and-expand? Mike Chang -- Chief Executive Officer For the mobile business there, definitely, we're looking for above 20%. That's for sure, OK? So they'll call the healthy one would be 25% to 30%. And we look into the momentum, we think, which is pretty practical. And probably in the Q3, we'll probably reach 25%. Greg Ellis -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst That's great. And that helps answer my last question. I'm not sure if this is for you or Yifan or even, Steve. But one, Yifan, can you clarify what the 300-millimeter revenue contribution is within the fiscal second-quarter guide? And from the first fiscal quarter, if we got the $7 million we were looking for, then there's about $30 million of revenue to get to that run-rate level in the September quarter of next year. If we were to break that down, $10 million in three buckets, how do we bridge the gap between where we are now and where we need to be late next year so that we're at that $37.5 million run rate? How much of that sort of differently comes from comms, from compute, from IPC, etc.? Yifan Liang -- Chief Financial Officer I'll start with this question. Yes, we said we're confident to reach the target run rate in the September quarter next year. This is -- right now is that we're gradually ramping up the 12-inch fab. It may not be linear. Right now, there's-we're doing the design-ins and wins using the products produced from the joint venture and also we're transferring some productions of our products to the joint ventures so that you can spare some room for our Oregon fab. So that transferring production requires a requalification with our customers. So those two things, depends on how it played out. And so I would expect and we need some time. Like -- as Mike and Stephen mentioned, some -- it takes some time to design-in and requalifications. So I would expect in the June quarter, you probably will see some, and in the September quarter, you will see most. Stephen Chang -- Executive Vice President And so I'll chime in. This is Stephen. The move to Chongqing actually helps not only the products that are moving to Chongqing, but also the products that stay behind in our eight-inch fab. So it actually helps with the total loading. So basically, I think every segment can benefit from the additional total capacity after we open up Chongqing to that level. Greg Ellis -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst But Stephen, in terms of getting from here to the target run rate with the new fab, is it fair to say that a majority of that is going to be communications? Or is it really going to be broader-based participation with the other segments? Stephen Chang -- Executive Vice President We're starting right now with initial segments that are -- we're ramping with, including computing, as well as various consumer applications. But like we said, we're trying to make room, especially going into Q3, which is a peak season for both computing, as well as communications, to make room for both of those applications when we're hitting that crunch of time like we did this year. So next year, with the more balanced opened-up capacity, we expect to more naturally, more comfortably address that demand. Greg Ellis -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst Thanks, guys. Good luck. Stephen Chang -- Executive Vice President Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Jeremy Kwan -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Yes. This is Jeremy calling for Tore. Let me add my congratulations on the cash flow profitability for the JV. I do know that some of that came from that intercompany payment. Can you tell us a little bit more about what that is and also what the $2.7 million interest refund is? Yifan Liang -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. I mean the $5.9 million impact was an intercompany receivable payables and balance. So right now, the joint venture is in the final stage of processing this loan paper work. So the loan itself has been approved, and right now, it's going through the final stage of the paper work. There are quite a bit bureaucracies over there so we have to be patient. In terms of the $2.7 million interest expense refund, that was a part of the joint venture agreement. So finally, we got approval from the local government, so the refund that came in, in the September quarter and then for the next two years, each September quarter for the next two years we will -- the joint venture is expected to receive that same amount of refund for the next two years. Jeremy Kwan -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst So that refund, it's basically interest that the JV paid to the finance company and that's being returned back to you? Yifan Liang -- Chief Financial Officer No. Those are the ones that are refunded on the interest expense they paid on the lease financing and loans. Jeremy Kwan -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst So the JV, they paid the interest on the lease finance loans and they get some of that back at the end of each year? Yifan Liang -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, yes, from the local government. Jeremy Kwan -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst From the local government. Got it. I see, OK. And then in terms of that intercompany receivable, you said that's related to a loan that's been approved, so that's... Yifan Liang -- Chief Financial Officer No, no, no. That's not related to loan. That's a normal business -- company balance. Jeremy Kwan -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst OK, and that's basically for -- I guess is that for -- is that based on expenses that AOS incurred on behalf of the JV? Yifan Liang -- Chief Financial Officer Well, they purchased some materials -- we first -- from us. And then they sell finished goods to us. I mean those ins and outs. Jeremy Kwan -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Got it, OK. And then the loan that you mentioned, that's still in the works. Do you have a quantification of how much that's going to be? Yifan Liang -- Chief Financial Officer We'll disclose it when we sign an agreement. Jeremy Kwan -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst OK. Great. And then I guess if we can move on to the JV. Can you give us an idea of how much business is currently running through that -- through the JV? Yifan Liang -- Chief Financial Officer For the September quarter, yes, they supported us for the incremental revenues. I mean right now, it is for the December guidance, we also factored in the ramp-up. Jeremy Kwan -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Got it. OK. And maybe just kind of getting at some of the earlier questions, but maybe looking at it a different way. If you look at that -- again, that incremental $37.5 million that you expect from the JV, can you -- do you have an idea of how much is based on products -- new products that you've introduced over the last maybe year or so or how much of it is related to maybe expanding opportunities from existing products? Yifan Liang -- Chief Financial Officer Well, those are relatively -- as Stephen mentioned, we're getting some existing products right now, qualified with PC customers initially when transferring some production to the joint venture. Relatively speaking, for the PC requalification process, normally is shorter than other products. So we've started from there. Later on, yes, we'll add-in other products that we'll produce from the 12-inch fab in the consumer area, in the power supply area as well. Jeremy Kwan -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Very good. And I guess also, you had mentioned price erosion earlier. Can you help us -- or at least pricing pressure impacting gross margin. Can you quantify that for us, and maybe what the expectations are for the next year or 12 to 18 months? Yifan Liang -- Chief Financial Officer OK, sure. In the last two years also, I would say the MOSFET industry was relatively tight and supply was tight and us, so the ASP environment was relatively favorable to us. This year, the market has been loosening up, and so after a couple of quarters. And now, it's getting to the point back to the normal, I would say. So right now, it's in the normal ASP erosion situation. What we want to do is to overcome those ASP erosion is to rolling out our new products. And so you provide better performance and you have commanding the better margins, so that offsetting those ASP erosion. Of course, that depends on the timing and the dynamics of those existing products versus new products. So from time to time, you may see new products overcome to the old products, and sometimes you may see some erosion temporarily. Jeremy Kwan -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst And in terms of the normal erosion, is that on the order of 3% to 5% annually? Is that kind of what you're looking at? Yifan Liang -- Chief Financial Officer It's more like mid-single digit to high single digit. Depends on the years and on the market situation, I would say. Jeremy Kwan -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst And that's compared to maybe flat to slightly down in the past years? Yifan Liang -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Jeremy Kwan -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst OK. And then if we look at the -- on the communications side, with the smartphone exposure, would you say the ASP dynamics there are similar to the rest of your products? Or is it a different dynamic, and also, in terms of the gross margin relative to corporate? Yifan Liang -- Chief Financial Officer In terms of ASP environment, I would say similar, than -- or maybe slightly better. In terms of margin profile in that segment, it is above our corporate average. Jeremy Kwan -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Very good. I think I'll leave it at that and maybe come back for more questions later. Thank you. Congratulations. Yifan Liang -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. I'll now turn the conference back over to your host for closing remarks. Mike Chang -- Chief Executive Officer This concludes our earnings call today. Thank you for your interest in AOS, and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you. Yifan Liang -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you.

Alpha & Omega Semiconductor stock traders use a variety of tools to make a prediction on which way the AOSL market is likely to head next. These tools can roughly be divided into indicators and chart patterns. When trying to make a Alpha & Omega Semiconductor stock forecast, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall. Moving averages are among the most popular Alpha & Omega Semiconductor stock prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for AOSL stock over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for AOSL is a sum of AOSL\u2019s closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12. In addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action. 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the stock market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the Alpha & Omega Semiconductor stock price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for Alpha & Omega Semiconductor stock. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually interpreted as a negative forecast for the AOSL market. Traders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the Alpha & Omega Semiconductor stock price. When making a Alpha & Omega Semiconductor stock forecast, most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of Alpha & Omega Semiconductor stock with different granularity \u2013 for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremely short-term price action or choose a weekly candlestick chart to identify long-terms trends. 1-hour, 4-hour and 1-day candlestick charts are among the most popular. Let\u2019s use a 1-hour candlestick chart as an example of how this type of price chart gives us information about opening and closing prices. The chart is divided into \u201ccandles\u201d that give us information about Alpha & Omega Semiconductor\u2019s stock price action in 1-hour chunks. Each candlestick will display AOSL\u2019s opening price, closing price, as well as the highest and lowest prices that Alpha & Omega Semiconductor reached within the 1-hour period. This information makes it easier to make an informed price prediction. It\u2019s also important to pay attention to the color of the candle \u2013 a green candle means that the closing price was higher than the opening price, while a red candle tells us the opposite. Some charts will use hollow and filled candlestick bodies instead of colors to represent the same thing. Just like with any other asset, the price action of Alpha & Omega Semiconductor stock is driven by supply and demand. These dynamics can be influenced by fundamental factors, such as earnings announcements, new product launches, acquisitions and mergers, and other factors. The AOSL stock price can also be influenced by market sentiment, broader economic conditions, interest rates, inflation rates and political developments. Some traders try to identify candlestick patterns when making stock price predictions to try and get an edge over the competition. Some candlestick formations are seen as likely to forecast bullish price action, while others are seen as bearish.
