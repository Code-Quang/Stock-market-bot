Operational Measures Definitions We reference bookings, which is an internal operational measure of the business. Bookings is defined as the total of the minimum annual contracted value for newly sold capabilities of our software-as-a-service, or SaaS, products over a given time period, inclusive of any corresponding vendor fees owed to Third Parties. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the financial measures presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin; non-GAAP operating income (loss); non-GAAP net income (loss); non-GAAP cost of revenue; non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses; non-GAAP research and development expenses; non-GAAP general and administrative expenses; and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Rather, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported GAAP financial results, provide investors with additional meaningful information to assess our financial performance and trends, enable comparison of financial results between periods, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics utilized internally in analyzing and operating our business. The following definitions are provided: Reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures are available in the accompanying schedules, which are posted as part of this earnings release on our website. No reconciliation is provided with respect to certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures as the GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis. We cannot reliably predict all necessary components or their impact to reconcile such financial measures without unreasonable effort. The events necessitating a non-GAAP adjustment are inherently unpredictable and may have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the financial measures presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin; non-GAAP operating income (loss); non-GAAP net income (loss); non-GAAP cost of revenue; non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses; non-GAAP research and development expenses; non-GAAP general and administrative expenses; and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Rather, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported GAAP financial results, provide investors with additional meaningful information to assess our financial performance and trends, enable comparison of financial results between periods, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics utilized internally in analyzing and operating our business. The following definitions are provided: Reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures are available in the accompanying schedules, which are posted as part of this earnings release on our website. No reconciliation is provided with respect to certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures as the GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis. We cannot reliably predict all necessary components or their impact to reconcile such financial measures without unreasonable effort. The events necessitating a non-GAAP adjustment are inherently unpredictable and may have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the financial measures presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin; non-GAAP operating income (loss); non-GAAP net income (loss); non-GAAP cost of revenue; non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses; non-GAAP research and development expenses; non-GAAP general and administrative expenses; and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Rather, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported GAAP financial results, provide investors with additional meaningful information to assess our financial performance and trends, enable comparison of financial results between periods, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics utilized internally in analyzing and operating our business. The following definitions are provided: The Company employs a structural long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate of 24% for greater consistency across reporting periods, eliminating effects of items not directly related to the Company's operating structure that may vary in size and frequency. This long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate is determined by analyzing a mix of historical and projected tax filing positions, assumes no additional acquisitions during the projection period or include the impact from the partial deferred tax asset valuation allowance, and takes into account various factors, including the Company\u2019s anticipated tax structure, its tax positions in different jurisdictions, and current impacts from key U.S. legislation where the Company operates. We will reevaluate this tax rate, as necessary, for significant events such as significant alterations in the U.S. tax environment, substantial changes in the Company\u2019s geographic earnings mix due to acquisition activity, or other shifts in the Company\u2019s strategy or business operations. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures are available in the accompanying schedules, which are posted as part of this earnings release on our website. No reconciliation is provided with respect to certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures as the GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis. We cannot reliably predict all necessary components or their impact to reconcile such financial measures without unreasonable effort. The events necessitating a non-GAAP adjustment are inherently unpredictable and may have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results. Forward-Looking Statements This release contains, and our above-referenced conference call and webcast will contain, statements which are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(MLNK -1.08%) Q1 2022 Earnings Call May 12, 2022, 5:00 p.m. ET Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standby, and welcome to MeridianLink's first quarter 2022 earnings call. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your first speaker today, Erik Schneider, head of investor relations. Erik, please go ahead. Erik Schneider -- Head of Investor Relations Good afternoon, and welcome to MeridianLink's first quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings call. We will be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market closed today. With me are MeridianLink's chief executive officer, Nicolaas Vlok, and chief financial officer, Chad Martin. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's conference call will include forward-looking statements based on the company's current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, and the other reports and filings we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made based on information available to us as of today, and except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During the call, we will also refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures included in our press release, which is posted to the investor relations section of our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Nicolaas. Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Erik, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you all for joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings call. I want to thank the entire MeridianLink team for helping us achieve another strong quarter, with continued growth and momentum throughout the business. Soon, Chad will discuss our Q1 financial performance, but I would like to provide an overview of what contributed to the quarter's solid performance. Q1 showed strong momentum outside the expected slowing in mortgage-related revenues as we've continued to improve our solutions, enabling our customers to perform well in the face of a normalizing market. We have maintained investments in our product and team, added partner integrations and increased the pace of customers going live on the platform. As a result, MeridianLink exceeded guidance again in Q1, with GAAP revenue up 7% year over year to $72.8 million and 47% adjusted EBITDA margins. I want to take a few minutes to discuss three particular areas of strength from the quarter. First, our continued offering expansion; second, our robust cross-sell engine; and third, our investments to more quickly onboard customers. These three important areas helped fuel our first quarter and I'm excited and confident in our continuing trajectory of delivering on our commitments to our customers, our employees, and our investors. First, offering expansion. Let's start by taking a look at new capabilities. We have a demonstrated history of introducing incremental product innovations on a continuous basis to help our customers succeed serving consumers. Today, I want to highlight two new products we are offering to customers, Engage and Atlas from StreetShares and two new partner relationships we are making available, Social Intelligence and Verafin. After a very successful Q4 beta with great customer feedback, we began 2022 by announcing the general availability of MeridianLink Engage, which builds on the foundation of our Saylent acquisition and the execution of our go-to-market plan. MeridianLink Engage enables financial institutions to increase engagement and profitability through data-driven lending campaigns. The Q1 launch of MeridianLink Engage is generating significant interest, with pipeline continuing to build as it provides our customers additional ways to capture incremental wallet share, while they delight consumers with better lending experiences. For example, one early credit union customer has leveraged MeridianLink Engage to target active members with auto loans elsewhere, driving auto loan refinance activity at their institution, contributing to a nearly 300% ROI measured to date on the campaign. The success of the Saylent acquisition and Engage launch highlights our ability to identify strategic acquisition opportunities and complete successful technological integrations to build upon our powerful platform. We pass on many more acquisition opportunities than we close, as we seek the right combination of a strategic fit, timing, and value. On our previous call in March, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire StreetShares to expand our small business lending offering to banks and credit unions. Bought by experienced business bankers, the offering specifically addresses the key challenges in small business risk assessment and decisioning to meet the financing needs of small businesses efficiently. I'm excited to confirm that we closed the transaction on April 1 and have been working with our new team members to execute our integration plans to provide this additional functionality as part of our MeridianLink One platform. These examples demonstrate a few inorganic ways we are adding to our long history of organic innovation, which continues as well. Another innovation accelerator is our Partner Marketplace, and we continue to add important capabilities. For example, in Q1, we announced a first-of-its-kind partnership with Social Intelligence, a social media screening organization. This new collaboration provides our background screening CRAs the ability to offer social media screening to their customers seamlessly within the TazWorks platform. Our Partner Marketplace continues to expand, offering customers tailored choices to improve their customers' experiences through high-quality, easy-to-use API integrations with leading organizations. An additional highlights from the first quarter is a signed integration agreement between MeridianLink and Verafin, an industry-leading anti-money laundering solution. Next, I would like to discuss cross-sell. All of these new capabilities are a great segue to talk about our success in cross-selling our solutions as they add to the revenue opportunity of our data verification and MeridianLink One platforms. As a reminder, MeridianLink One is our platform of lending products, which spans a digital consumer lending journey from account opening through loan origination and data collection, decisioning and funding. For example, one existing customer, a bank with over $9 billion in assets, added MeridianLink Mortgage and MeridianLink Portal in Q1. They were considering other solutions but ultimately chose MeridianLink due to our enhanced integrations and automation functionality. Specifically, the bank was looking for a more competitive web-based solution with enhanced reporting, automation and visualization. They needed to simplify their processing workflow and eliminate manual tracking. In their words, they were looking for a completely digital experience for the customer and found their ideal technology partner in Meridianlink. Enabled by the seamless interface and data integration of MeridianLink One, our debt optimization functionality was awarded a patent in Q1. This combination of the capabilities of our lending and data verification software solutions enables our customers to offer differentiated lending options that monoline lenders, for those operating disconnected systems, simply cannot. In the quarter, we released the next phase of debt optimization to expand the types of loans that can be underwritten and offered through these unique capabilities. I'd also like to share an update about our successful in-person user forum. Last week, we hosted nearly 1,000 attendees from hundreds of customers and dozens of partners in Huntington Beach for our annual user forum, the first time we hosted the event live since 2019. The energy and excitement were palpable as we connected about how our solutions help customers deliver the personalized speedy experiences that today's consumers expect. The positive feedback and stories were inspiring and validating for our entire team. It was a great reminder of why we do what we do. It was also greater spent time in person with many of our employees, who are the reason for our continued success and excellence. My last update would be discussing bringing customers online more quickly. And I'd like to talk about how the increasing recognition of our market leadership with MeridianLink One and the associated strength in selling to both new and existing customers makes even more imperative investments we are making to bring customers online more quickly. While our hiring is somewhat behind schedule, the productivity of new and existing team members is in line with our expectations. In Q1, we were excited to add Liz Rieveley to our executive leadership team as MeridianLink's new chief people officer. With the benefit of Liz's expertise, we will accelerate our hiring and investment in additional people initiatives. We see the 30% year-over-year growth in services revenue in Q1 as indicative of the opportunity and expect to see sustained improvements in total time between contract signing and customer go live as the investments in our services team come to fruition. It's heartening to see the progress we are making and I'm confident in our accelerating momentum. Of course, none of this would be possible without the hard work of our dedicated team. Before I turn the call over to Chad, I'd like to discuss our continued success in migrating to the cloud. The work stream to complete the rearchitecture and deployment of the entire MeridianLink One platform in the cloud remains on schedule for the first quarter involving the prep work needed to migrate MeridianLink mortgage to the cloud during the second quarter. I am happy to confirm that we remain on track to remigrate the final components of our platforms to the cloud this year, at which point our MeridianLink One platform will be completely cloud native. I will now turn the call over to Chad to talk about our financial results and guidance. Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Nicolaas. And thanks again, to everyone for joining us today. I'll start by providing the highlights for the quarter, then I will recap the highlights of our financial model and provide our results in more detail, before finally giving guidance for the second quarter and full year 2022. As Nicolaas mentioned, in the first quarter, we generated total revenue of $72.8 million, up 7% year over year. 87% of our first quarter revenues were subscription fees, with the balance coming from professional services and other. Our GAAP operating income was $14.6 million, our non-GAAP operating income was $20.8 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $34 million. As a quick reminder, we have a usage-based SaaS recurring revenue model. Our customers sign long-term contracts, usually three years, that are not cancelable without penalty in which auto renew at the end of term. Typically, customers commit to annual fees and monthly purchases of applications or reports. In exchange for higher monthly commitments, they receive lower per unit pricing and any transaction over the monthly minimum commitment is an incremental charge. Our platform's ability to make our customers more efficient and effective naturally drives more volume once it is installed and used so we can grow with our customers and we are aligned with their success. We provide both lending software solutions and data verification software solutions. In the first quarter, lending software solutions revenue accounted for nearly 68% of our total revenue and grew 14% year over year. Excluding the impact from the anticipated slowdown in mortgage-related revenues, our lending software solutions revenues grew 19% year over year. The remainder of our revenues come from data verification software solutions, which decreased 4% year over year as mortgage-related revenues declined. First quarter revenues from the mortgage loan market generated 28% of our overall revenues, more than previously expected as we believe the surge in mortgage interest rates pulled forward some demand. Specifically, 7% of our lending software solution revenues and 70% of our data verification software solutions revenues were tied to our mortgage-focused products in the first quarter. While the majority of our data verification software solutions revenue is tied to mortgage, this part of our business outperformed the market as we continue to find ways to augment our solutions with additional data items and partners to provide more value to our customers, enabling them to continue to win share in the market. The seven points of year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter came primarily from our standard growth drivers, as we added new customers, saw increased module penetration and increased volumes from our existing customers. We expect to drive further growth as we bring additional capabilities to our customers through a combination of M&A, expansion of our partner marketplace and delivery of organically developed products. Moving to our profitability. Gross margin in Q1 was 66%. Adjusted for stock-based compensation, gross margin was 72%. We continue to invest in our sales and marketing and R&D efforts to drive organic growth acceleration. Compared to the first quarter last year, we spent 25% more in sales and marketing and 6% more in R&D, adjusted for stock-based compensation. With this additional spend, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%. We will continue to invest across the year to accelerate our underlying growth. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the first quarter with $146.7 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, up $33.1 million from the end of the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $34.9 million, and free cash flow was $32.9 million or a 45% free cash flow margin. We continue to generate funds that can be used to invest in the business, pursue acquisitions, deleverage or repurchase shares under our recently authorized repurchase capacity of up to $75 million in common stock. I will now conclude the call by providing guidance for Q2 and an update for the full year of 2022. Despite the rapid rise in mortgage interest rates since the start of the year and the associated decrease in expected market volumes, we continue to see strong momentum overall, and our pipeline remains robust. For the second quarter, estimated total revenue is expected to be between $71.5 million and $73.5 million compared to $68.5 million for the same period in 2021. This represents an estimated increase of 4% to 7% year over year. In the second quarter of 2021, the mortgage market contributed $20.3 million of revenue to MeridianLink or just under a third of our revenue in the year ago quarter. We expect the mortgage market to contribute less than 25% of revenue for the second quarter of 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, our second quarter estimated adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $25 million and $27 million, representing EBITDA margins of approximately 36% at the midpoint of the range. While our reported Q1 adjusted EBITDA came in well above our previous guidance, this was primarily due to underspending plans in the quarter, and we intend to accelerate spend in our outlined initiatives throughout the remainder of the year. This includes approximately $1 million per quarter to bring the recently acquired StreetShares solution fully to market as part of MeridianLink One. For the full year 2022, estimated total revenue is expected to be between $289 million and $293 million, compared to $267.7 million for the same period in 2021. This represents an estimated increase of 8% to 9% year over year. On a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2022 estimated adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $112 million and $116 million, representing EBITDA margins of approximately 39% at the midpoint of the range. The lower year-over-year margin reflects anticipated increases in annual spending in areas that will drive future growth as described earlier by Nicolaas. We will continue to focus on the investment in services capacity to convert more bookings to revenue and the investment in development in the cloud to both enhance and expand our product suite, both items that require current expense that we expect will lead to future returns. As we forecast the balance of 2022, the normalization of activity in the mortgage lending market appears to be well underway. We expect this to continue being a minor headwind in lending software and a more meaningful drag on data verification software performance in the quarters ahead. Overall, the mortgage-related percentage of our revenue in 2022 is expected to decrease to the low 20s, down from 30% in 2021, subtracting more than five percentage points of growth from MeridianLink in 2022. While this reduction is more than we anticipated at the start of the year, as we have seen rates move higher faster than previously forecast, we have been building our business to counter the decline for some time. We have no doubt that we will continue adding new clients, providing more value to our customers and therefore, increasing revenue for MeridianLink as a whole, and our guidance for the year reflects the ongoing strength of the non-mortgage solutions we provide, which grew 17% year over year in our most recent quarter. With that, Nicolaas and I are happy to take any questions. Operator? Operator Sure, sir. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda with Bank of America. Please go ahead, please. Lory Luo -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi. This is Lory Luo on for Koji. So thanks for taking my question. So I got a couple. The first one is on the StreetShares acquisition. What's the contribution there for the full year, given that the weak refi market, but you guys still guided up for the full year? And then second, how do you think about like what's the growth driver on the consumer side on auto demand and also what are the other growth drivers there? Thank you. Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. This is Chad Martin speaking. On the StreetShares, so we do have that built into the full year. It will be basically -- it's not a material acquisition for us from a revenue perspective. It's basically around one point of revenue growth year over year, less than $1 million a quarter for the balance of the year. And then the growth drivers on the consumer side, right, we continue to see, as we've talked about in the past, the same kind of growth drivers pushing the nonmortgage consumer lending space. So the growth in new customers, the growth in our customers' volumes, as well as cross-sell and upsell into those entities. And if you look at the growth in the lending side for the first quarter, was up 14%. And if you adjust that for mortgage, it was up around 19%. So continuing to expecting to see consumer growth in the teens. Lory Luo -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Good. Great. That's helpful. And just to follow up, do you have -- can you share any color on our consumer side, how's the auto mix there? It's considered as like majority of the consumer loan. Is that still going to be the case going forward? Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So we have not seen any real material change in our mix on the non-mortgage side of the business. Auto is the largest component of the consumer piece. And that's been doing pretty well. I think you've seen some of the data around used cars, prices coming down and some constraints around supply easing up. So we continue to see that to be a material contributor to the volumes and no real change as we expected going forward for the year. Lory Luo -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Great. Just one last one for me is, do you have any data on the mix of new auto versus the used car percentage? Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer We don't. We don't split out kind of the overall loans by the auto type, and we certainly don't split it into new and used. And I don't think we, frankly, actually, on the back end, necessarily see that because an auto loan is an auto loan from how our system would process it. Lory Luo -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Gotcha. Okay. Thanks. Thanks very much. Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Yep. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Schmidt -- Citi -- Analyst Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just to start off on the -- just the annual revenue outlook. Obviously, you take out StreetShares and the outperformance in the first quarter, a little bit of a guide down for the rest of the year. Is that -- I just want to put a finer point on that. Is that mostly mortgage outperformance in the first quarter, what you feel is a pull forward and more of a softening given the rate environment we're seeing for the rest of the year? Or are there other factors? I know hiring has been a little bit slower. So wondering if there's any impact on the implementation side or if this is purely sort of more rates driven for mortgages. Just looking to get a little more color there. Thanks a lot. Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Andrew. Good question. Good question. It is mostly driven by mortgage. We did see our percent of revenue from mortgage come in slightly higher in Q1 than we'd initially guided. We think we saw a bit of a last gasp as rates started rising and some of the mortgage volume push through in Q1. So we think we did pull a little bit of revenue into the first quarter from -- for the year. And then, yes, we're guiding now for the balance of the year to be down from kind of the mid-20s to the low 28% of mortgage for the year. So a couple of points of drag there on 2022 in the back half of the year. But again, also seeing the strength on the consumer side, helping to kind of make up that gap. Andrew Schmidt -- Citi -- Analyst That's helpful. So it sounds like you're working through the backlog as expected on the consumer... Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Sorry. Your question around hiring and bringing folks on. Yes. So we've actually -- a lot of our emphasis has been on filling those positions in the services team. So we're not quite exactly where we want to be, but we are bringing folks on. We're seeing their productivity as Nicolaas discussed in his remarks, and so they are having the impact that we're expecting. But nothing that is kind of either swinging the number higher or lower from what we'd initially put forward for '22. Andrew Schmidt -- Citi -- Analyst Very helpful. And then it seems like overall, the consumer remains relatively healthy, but obviously, there are concerns about more economic turbulence as the year progresses. There are puts and takes, obviously, some types of demand for some types of loans go down but could be offset by demand for other types of loans. Could you just remind us sort of the sensitivity of the business to economic turbulence, how you think about that just various puts and takes at a high level? That would be helpful. Thanks. Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Andrew. So as we think about the sensitivity, right, I mean, the best kind of view we have of the sensitivity of the consumer market is just looking kind of retrospectively. And if you look at kind of the last 20-plus years, absent one year in the Great Recession, that consumer loan behaviors, consumer lending has grown every year. So it is a pretty -- it is not very sensitive, I would say, to kind of the macro movements for the economic shifts. And so we're using and leveraging what we see from the folks who kind of call the market for consumer. CUNA has 2022 growing 8% year over year, up from 6% last year. I think that's a slight decline from the 9% they called at the beginning of the year, but our volumes still reflects that we see kind of growth in this space in line with that. And so we're not expecting -- we don't know what we don't know in terms of other kind of macroeconomic shifts that may occur. But given kind of the current environment, we're comfortable with what we have put in for the forecast for the balance of the year. Andrew Schmidt -- Citi -- Analyst Very helpful. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks a lot. I appreciate the comments. Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Andrew. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please go ahead. Saket Kalia -- Barclays -- Analyst OK. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Nicolaas, maybe I'll start with you. A little bit of a similar question, but just a little bit more specific. As you think about new customers in the lending solutions business, what have you typically seen in terms of new deals, new customer wins during rising rate environments? And what I mean by that is, is the rising rate environment sometimes a catalyst for a bank or a credit union to invest while interest income is better? Or do they maybe handle their investments differently in rising rates/kind of more uncertain environment? Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Saket. And a great question. And if I may respond, I may actually weave in some comments to the two previous folks who asked questions as well. But our take is on the consumer lending side, the overall trends remains largely unchanged. And Chad highlighted the CUNA data that is as recent as April. And we continue to see FIs making continued investments in digital transformation. In fact, I would say coming off from our user forum last week, where it was nearly 1,000 folks interacting with us at a high pace for four days, I walked away with some very strong views on a lot of our customers are embarking on a journey, and this is a multiyear journey, and they are rethinking their business to be on the digital transformation bus, so to speak. And some have made some real steps forward. Others are kind of getting into it. And I believe that with rising rates, it creates an opportunity for our core LOS customers, which are the positively taking institutions, to differentiate themselves here in the lending market. I think it's a playbook that plays into our platform and what we've been investing in for the last three, four years. And I would add that many of our customers are sitting on a large base of deposits that came in during times of COVID stimulus. And higher rates are a catalyst for them to put that money to work by extending credit. And in this type of environment, I feel it's a good opportunity for us to also position our new Engage product, which is more focused on enabling our customers to be very targeted in their marketing, trying to focus on increasing their lending portfolio the way they choose to go do it. And on top of that, we've also seen strong interest and a push by our customer base into HELOCs. And I expect that to be kind of a loan channel on the consumer side, where those folks that will grow, where those folks want to take advantage of equity in people's homes and offset some of the refi drop some of them have experienced. And another loan channel that I continue to hear more interest from is personal loans, and I expect that to be also a strong area of interest now that stimulus has started relaxing. And my take is rising interest rates based on a larger than usual deposit base, is a market that MeridianLink can play very well in. Saket Kalia -- Barclays -- Analyst Got it. That's very helpful. Maybe for my follow-up, I'll just keep it to two here. Chad, for you, obviously, that conversion for the strong bookings in '21 to revenue in '22 and going forward is going to be contingent on sort of that hiring in the services organization. Can you just give us sort of a sense for where you are? And just as importantly, what is that gross margin or cost of sales line don't look here through '22 as again, you invest ahead of that revenue? Does that make sense? Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Yes. That makes sense. So we are hiring. We were a little bit better on margin in Q1. I think we were a little bit behind our overall company hiring as well as just kind of had some deferred initiatives that kind of pushed into the back of the year. But we did -- the full year, our margin guidance is in a similar place where we're going to see some impact on 2022 gross margins, mostly around adding the services resources. But we think that, that investment is prudent because that will bring on the revenue, as you referenced, that will kind of take margins back up through time, because we think we're going to kind of rightsize the services group and then not need to kind of continue to add and augment going forward, and we'll have the capacity to kind of convert the good growth we're seeing in bookings into revenue at the appropriate pace. So will be a bit of a drag on '22 gross margins, but we're still comfortable with our long-term margin guidance as we kind of see that being a onetime investment that pays off this year and next. Saket Kalia -- Barclays -- Analyst Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Nik Cremo with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Nik Cremo -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Hey. Thanks very much for taking my question. First, I wanted to ask about the contract minimums that Chad was discussing in the prepared remarks and if you guys could give us any kind of high-level color as to what the contract minimums represent in the 2022 guide? Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Sure, Nik. So we do have contract minimums. Most of our customers still set their minimum at a rate at which they usually exceed during the months of the year. They typically pick a number that is tied to their low point in volume on a seasonal basis. And so in our guidance for the year, I would -- and many customers are substantially above their historical minimum or their contract minimum, especially those customers who have been on historical contracts that were set, they set their minimums a while ago. So as it relates to our '22 guidance, the minimums aren't really something that we forecast or talk about in how we set our budget. We expect most customers to exceed that. And therefore, we focus more on what we think volume -- our number of customers will be and the volume from our customers. But every year that we kind of bring more customers on or customers reset their minimums that, that minimum level of revenue is increasing but it's still not the preponderance of our overall revenue streams. Nik Cremo -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst OK. Got it. Understood. And then as my follow-up, I just wanted to get a sense for what kind of cost savings we could see from MeridianLink One being completely in the cloud by the end of the year? Is that something that we would see in gross margins in 2023? Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer So from the margin perspective, candidly, '22 will be an increased cost as we move all the customers into the cloud but still have the costs of our data centers that we're carrying until we kind of get the full movement in motion into the cloud so we can begin to wind those data center costs down. But we do expect in '23 that there will be benefit to the overall margin. One, once we get our customers all in the cloud and have a better understanding for how we can kind of optimize our cloud spend with our cloud partners. And then two, the reduction in our data center costs. That will create some reduction in spend in '23. But candidly, '22, where we're both carrying the data center and the migration, we won't see much savings in this year. Nik Cremo -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Got it. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matt VanVliet with BTIG. Good afternoon. Matt VanVliet -- BTIG -- Analyst Please go ahead. Yeah.Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to maybe dig in a little bit in terms of what you've seen so far year to date as rates have been going up if there's much -- whether it's mix shift or just overall demand across or any differences between credit unions and maybe smaller regional or smaller community banks and then maybe some of your larger banks out there? Just if you're seeing any kind of difference of activity within those different groups of institutions? Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. I would highlight what I've said a little earlier, more interest in HELOCs than in the past, also personal loans. But then the bigger story is as folks are engaging and very committed to digital transformation for their businesses. And from our standpoint, we continue to see high levels of activity and high levels of engagement. And my experience at our user forum was very buoyant, that exceeded my expectations in client engagement and the questions and what folks are planning on for the next year, two years, three years, the number of hand raisers and attendees and breakout sessions. I would tell you it is busy, people are looking at how to accelerate their business. And my sense right now is that the CUNA data that we've referenced a little earlier is not far off. Something big would need to change, in my opinion, to impact the trajectory of, call it, Main Street Americas financial institutions. Matt VanVliet -- BTIG -- Analyst All right. That's very helpful. And then any update you want to share in terms of the uptake on MeridianLink One? And then some of the other kind of add-on modules whether it's some of the more kind of direct targeting, direct marketing type of modules you have out there and sort of what the uptake has been on those as a number of your clients are looking to drive that interest income as much as possible? Thanks. Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Continue to see great traction, great momentum with our ability to deliver a platform for our clients. Very excited to be in the cloud by the end of the year, which is going to continue to enable us to scale and do more with the platform from an overall integration analytics automation standpoint. And MeridianLink is doing really well, keeping pace with that commitment. In addition, we also have had a very successful beta program and then a launch of Engage with really strong top of funnel metrics, specifically to your question on that and expect to start seeing more of that convert in the second half of the year into bookings from clients who is leaning into the solution, leaning into automation, leaning into more data-driven personalized lending playbooks. So very pleased with the, call it, momentum to date with what we've seen. Matt VanVliet -- BTIG -- Analyst All right. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Cris Kennedy with William Blair. Please go ahead. Cris Kennedy -- William Blair -- Analyst Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I apologize if I missed it, but did you talk about how bookings were in the first quarter? I think they were at record levels in the fourth quarter. Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Again, we've seen a good quarter overall. I don't think we've announced a number of new client wins, but it was up in a decent new client one quarter for us. The business has continued to work and move forward. I can tell you we're excited about product launches. We're excited about where we're at, bringing in some new sales folks, bringing them online. So really well positioned for the year, driving growth. Cris Kennedy -- William Blair -- Analyst OK. Great. And then just a follow-up on the sales force investments, can you kind of talk about where we are in that journey and how the productivity of your investments are progressing? Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. We'll continue to invest in the tech stack. And from a MeridianLink standpoint, we believe in automation and also efficiency gains through the tech stack as we drive scaling in the business. The investments are going well. We're pretty pleased with the systems we have and that we've been working on over the last few years. It should position the company well to layer in additional acquisitions that will position us well to continue to add go-to-market resources in the business. Feeling good about the path and trajectory forward with it. Cris Kennedy -- William Blair -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Sklar with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Alex Sklar -- Raymond James -- Analyst Thanks, Nicolaas. I wanted to ask specifically about the cross-sell of your mortgage LOS to consumer LOS customers. Now with the better integration between those two solutions, I know you named one win in the prepared remarks, but can you just talk about that cross-sell motion in particular? And what percentage of your consumer LOS customers take the mortgage lending product? Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer That's a good question. From a cross-sell standpoint, it's a great opportunity ahead of us. We see depository taking institutions as a playbook that we're going to continue to expand on. Historically, that was not the focus. It kind of became more of a focus over the last 12, 18 months with our platform playbook coming to reality. It is, I would say, still single-digit customer penetration and something that our team is focused on in driving and feel it's from a cross-sell standpoint, especially with the focus on where the market is heading, an opportunity that will play out in our favor over the course of the next few years. Alex Sklar -- Raymond James -- Analyst OK. Great. And then on the sales hiring efforts, kind of referring back to an earlier question, but can you just walk us through where you stand in terms of overall headcount now in there? And what kind of the target is for the end of the year if that change fill? Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. From a headcount hiring standpoint, we continue to drive hiring. And I would say, found some great people in the course of the quarter, especially in a fairly challenging or a very challenging hiring marketplace to date. Excited about the talent that have joined us. We would love to see more of the same quality of talent join the company and integrate into our sales leadership and our sales and go-to-market motions. We certainly build out capacity on the marketing side as well to lead on the forefront with campaigns and initiatives for our sales team. So mostly keeping pace in our go-to-market organization would have loved to maybe have a handful of hires knockdown in Q1. But overall, no major concerns from the sales and marketing hiring we've done in Q1 leading into Q2. Alex Sklar -- Raymond James -- Analyst All right. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Parker Lane with Stifel. Please go ahead. Max Osnowitz -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Hey, guys. It's Max Osnowitz on for Parker Lane. I want to start just by circling back on Engage and the early success that you guys have seen. Is it really attracting a new set of customers that aren't using other MeridianLink products? Or is it kind of bridge the gap and completed the package, so to speak, on MeridianLink's offerings? Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer It does both. But our initial focus and focus for 2022 is more on driving cross-sell and upsell. And again, referencing our user forum from last week, that was a very big cross-sell, upsell playbook for us and our account management team and Engage was on the forefront of the discussions. My take right now is, we can be more than successful and continue to drive significant cross-sell, upsell opportunities this year, next year being heavily focused on the existing customer base. But that is not the playbook after, call it, initial launch traction. It will expand and we will drive also new logo sales with it. Max Osnowitz -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Got it. And then just thinking about the StreetShares acquisition, is that going to complement the template-based offering you've created for the smaller business lenders? And how should we think about the size of that kind of customer group and its contribution to overall revenue going forward as you add more solutions? Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. We've had our own small business lending module for our platform, which has found good traction. The StreetShares solution is just a broader, deeper offering, and we really like what they've done with automation and decisioning, and the relationships that they've built with industry partners. Think of small business lending as loans to small businesses of $1 million or less and that's kind of a very rough circle of growing. And we've looked at the market, we know what's available. We know who we're competing against. And StreetShares, from a product standpoint, is a fantastic product. It's a cloud-native product and it integrates well into our own strategy as well as our platform. So excited to expand the small business offering that MeridianLink had with the strength and the breadth and depth of the StreetShares solution. Max Osnowitz -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Got it. Thanks. Operator [Operator instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Schmidt -- Citi -- Analyst Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my follow up. I just wanted to ask a higher-level portfolio question. Kind of actually tabbing onto that -- the previous question. StreetShares gives you more sophisticated capabilities and small business lending. Does it also create sort of more of a road map for just adding more capabilities in general business or commercial? Just curious how you think about the opportunity in business and commercial relative to the core consumer business. Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Great question, Andrew. Our focus is very much on consumer and the type of small business lending that we focused on is the consumer, who is a small business owner and typically the credit profile of the small business owner backs up the decision that's tied into lending to the small business on our Main Street. The differentiation between what we do and call it more full-blown commercial lending is it's a very different decision cycle, it's a very different playbook on the commercial lending side, which tends to be focused on a lot more analysis from the financial standpoint balance sheet, cash flow, which is typically not the small business lending our clients are engaging in as it relates to a specific consumer. And our focus is providing more value in, call it, that $1 million and below market with a consumer kind of being the credit profile that get decision. Andrew Schmidt -- Citi -- Analyst Understood. Thanks, Nicolaas. Appreciate the comments. Operator And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to our CEO, Nicolaas Vlok, for closing remarks.

(MLNK -1.08%) Q4 2021 Earnings Call Mar 10, 2022, 5:00 p.m. ET Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to MeridianLink's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your first speaker today, Erik Schneider, head of investor relations. Erik, please go ahead.

You can find the reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures included in our press release, which is posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Nicolaas. Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Erik, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you all for joining us for our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 earnings call. 2021 was a very successful year with strong growth, and Q4 continued to show strong momentum outside the expected slowing in mortgage-related revenues. As a result, MeridianLink exceeded guidance again in Q4 with GAAP revenue up 19% year over year to $64 million and 38% adjusted EBITDA margins. In a few minutes, Chad will provide additional details on these results and provide 2022 guidance. But first, I will provide some details on what we are seeing in the macro backdrop and on key areas of strength during the quarter. We continue to see notable strength in the consumer lending side of our business with strong momentum in the fourth quarter, up 23% year-over-year. This strength has been driven in part by the reinvestment of our mortgage-related upside into the rest of our lending business. In line with our guidance, the impact of mortgage on both our lending software and data verification software revenue types declined in the fourth quarter. Mortgage came in at approximately 27% of revenues during the quarter, and we expect this percentage to decline further in 2022 due to both the expected weakening of mortgage volumes and to the continued outperformance of our consumer lending solutions. As you know, MeridianLink One is a comprehensive, consolidated all-in-one cloud platform that supports all consumer loan and account types, including mortgage. We believe MeridianLink is outperforming in our market due to our diversified portfolio of products offered in our integrated platform and the continuing strong digitalization tailwinds. Moving on to key areas of strength. There are three things I would like to talk about: one, our increasingly robust go-to-market engine and how that is driving continued momentum in both new logo ones and cross-sell; two, innovation, including product suite integration, modernization, and expansion and how this is driving One; And thirdly, reduced implementation times and how these are driving faster go-lives and helping us to invoice sooner. So let's talk about these three in more detail. Q4 was a record bookings quarter for us with new logos wins the highest ever, driven by continued investment in our go-to-market engine. We now have nearly 50 quota-carrying reps in the field, and digitalization is top of mind for customers and prospects. Our return on this investment has been tremendous, generating high demand from potential clients. We will continue to invest both in strengthening our position in our sweet spot and extending beyond it, unlocking new market opportunities. One large Q4 opportunity was a win from a fast-growing digital mortgage platform designed exclusively for small to midsized mortgage lenders with more than $150 billion funded in working with more than 300 lenders. They invested more than $1 million in MeridianLink Mortgage in year one, and we are confident enhanced messaging of MeridianLink's open API technology, multitenant architecture and collaborative approach to growing clients' businesses will continue to drive larger lands. Conversely, MeridianLink entry has enabled wins of institutions smaller than our typical customer through a wholly templatized implementation. These are smaller dollar contracts than our typical customer, but it further extends our market-leading capabilities to institutions of all sizes who are committed to providing the best capabilities in the market. In addition, cross-selling is accelerating. In Q4, a $500 million-plus national credit union added MeridianLink Opening to their portfolio of MeridianLink products, which now includes MeridianLink Consumer, MeridianLink Portal, and MeridianLink Consulting. Secondly, our commitment to delivering innovation that is meaningful to our customers is also driving momentum. When new logos or current clients select MeridianLink, they repeatedly save a trust MeridianLink to help grow their business because of our market leadership and innovation. We continuously improve solutions for all clients. Most recently, for CRA clients, we combined the leading independent credit background and tenant screening platforms. In lending, we brought together leading independent products for credit unions and community banks across consumer point-of-sale, account opening, deposit taking, direct lending, and indirect lending. We also launched MeridianLink Engage in beta in Q4 and expanded to general availability in January. Engage is a unique and comprehensive end-to-end consumer lending, account, and card marketing automation solution, and we are seeing good initial engagement from prospects at the top of our sales funnel. Our engineering team also migrated MeridianLink Portal for consumer lending from our hosting environment to the public cloud in Q4. This is our largest migration to date, and it allows us to offer increased scalability and higher speed to clients while improving our ability to iterate and improve the underlying product technology. In 2022, we will complete the MeridianLink One platform rollout, providing the full breadth of our lending solution in the public cloud with a unified user experience. Thirdly, organic and inorganic investments in both solutions and go-to-market activities have meaningfully increased our bookings rate. And on the last call, I told you client demand for our capabilities, exceeded our ability to implement them. COVID-19 increased customer demand for integrated, comprehensive digital processes but slowed implementation since portions of the go-live process need to be performed synchronously to accomplish these best outcomes. As mentioned previously, we have developed and launched standardized product and service packages that bring smaller clients live more quickly and using up to two-thirds less effort from our professional services team. We also invested in process improvements that accelerate the portion of the implementation timeline we control. This helped us close the year with an accelerating number of go-lives across core products. We expect the investments completed and underway in our services team to reduce total time from signing to go-live by about 30%. These investments are necessary to work down our backlog and keep up with the ongoing growth in bookings. We expect a very strong return on the spend, bringing clients online faster as a meaningful financial impact. Before I turn the call over to Chad, I want to give you some high-level thoughts on 2022. When we think about 2022, we are more confident than ever in our go-to-market and innovation engines. We are penetrating more of our TAM as we continue to win opportunistically outside our sales sweet spot. Our cross-sell muscle is building, and we are increasingly monetizing our partner marketplace. MeridianLink will also remain a disciplined company in 2022. We've been able to deliver consistent double-digit top-line growth, along with profitability levels well above those of our public fintech peers. None of this is new. This is what you have come to expect of MeridianLink. The big story for 2022 will be bringing customers online more quickly. I mentioned the investments we are making, and we'll continue to make in our go-to-market organization. This is what we have guided for. But candidly, we have been more successful than we anticipated in generating demand and have proven that adding to our go-to-market organization produces very high returns. We will continue to ramp up our sales and marketing team to leverage our already strong position and create further distance between us and the competition. As a result, we are increasing investments to accelerate implementation capacity. As we increase hiring, we expect short-term margin pressure, but this investment will allow us to bring recurring revenue online more quickly and improve the go-live experience for our customers. As we closed out the last quarter of our first year as a public company, I'm pleased to see our strong execution on key growth initiatives, and I'm confident this success will continue. As always, I'd like to thank our employees. It is their dedication to and collaboration with our customers that drives our momentum. We also want to thank our new and existing customers for their trust in us to drive outcomes for their clients and communities. I will now turn the call over to Chad to talk about our financial results. Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Nicolaas, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. Since this is our first year-end earnings call, I'll start by providing the highlights for the quarter and the year. Then I will recap the highlights of our financial model and provide our results in more detail before finally giving guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2022. As Nicolaas mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we generated total revenue of $64 million, up 19% year over year. 87% of our fourth quarter revenues were subscription fees with the balance coming from professional services and other. Our operating income was $7.8 million, but our non-GAAP operating income was $11.7 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $24.6 million. For the full year 2021, operating income was $37.7 million. Our non-GAAP operating income was $70.8 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $123.4 million for the year. Our IPO was completed during the third quarter. So the fourth quarter of 2021 gives an indication of what we believe is the likely level of ongoing stock-based compensation and public company reporting costs. We have a usage-based SaaS recurring revenue model. Our customers signed long-term contracts, usually three years ,that are not cancelable without penalty and which auto-renew at the end of term. Typically, customers commit to annual fees and monthly purchases of applications. In exchange for higher monthly commitment, they receive lower per application pricing, and any transaction over the monthly minimum commitment is an incremental charge. Our platform's ability to make our customers more efficient and effective at lending naturally drives more volume once it is installed and used. We can grow with our customers, and we are aligned with their success. We provide both lending software solutions and data verification software solutions. In the fourth quarter, lending software solutions revenues accounted for nearly 68% of our total revenue and grew 18% year over year. The remainder of our revenues come from data verification software solutions, which increased 20% year over year. For the full year 2021, lending software solutions revenues accounted for nearly 66% of our total revenue and grew 32% year over year. The remainder of our revenues come from data verification software solutions, which increased 39% year over year. Fourth-quarter revenues from the mortgage loan market generated 27% of our overall revenues. Specifically, 9% of our lending software solutions revenues and 68% of our data verification software solution revenues were tied to our mortgage-focused products. For the full year 2021, revenues from the mortgage loan market generated 30% of our overall revenues, composed of 9% of lending software solutions and 70% of data verification software solutions. Of our 19 points of year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter, 13 points were contributed by the acquisitions of TCI and TazWorks, while the remaining growth came primarily through the addition of new customers, increased module penetration of existing customers, and increased volume from our customers. As a reminder, TCI was acquired during the fourth quarter of 2020, so the growth contribution this quarter is less than in previous quarters of 2021 as TCI revenue was partially in the 2020 comparable base. As expected, organic growth from data verification software solutions trended lower year over year, but growth from lending software solutions, excluding TCI, remained robust, growing double digits versus the prior-year period. Gross margin in Q4 was 65%. But adjusted for stock-based compensation, it was 72%. We continue to invest in our sales and marketing and R&D efforts to drive organic growth acceleration. We are investing significantly to build robust sales and marketing capabilities. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, we spent 53% more in sales and marketing and 48% more in R&D adjusted for stock-based compensation. With this additional spend, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 38%, and our adjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately $3.7 million to $24.6 million. For the full year 2021, sales and marketing and R&D spend grew by a total of 76% and 57%, respectively, again, adjusted for stock-based compensation. 2021 EBITDA grew by $18.8 million to $123.4 million or 18%, and EBITDA margin was 46%. We will continue to invest to accelerate our underlying growth in 2022. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the fourth quarter with $113.6 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, up $20.6 million from the end of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we completed the refinancing of our credit facility. We were able to extend the duration of our term loan and increase the size of our revolving credit facility while reducing the initial floating interest rate by 50 basis points. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $20.8 million, and free cash flow was $19.4 million in the fourth quarter or a 30% free cash flow margin. For the full year 2021, operating cash flow was $89.8 million, and free cash flow was $84.1 million, or a 31% free cash flow margin. We continue to generate funds that can be used to invest in the business, pursue acquisitions or deleverage. I will now conclude the call by providing guidance for Q1 and for the full year of 2022. Overall, we continue to see strong business momentum, and our pipeline remains robust. For the first quarter, estimated total revenue is expected to be between $68.3 million and $69.3 million, compared to $67.8 million for the same period in 2021. This represents an estimated increase of 1% to 2% year over year. In the first quarter of 2021, the mortgage market contributed $22.7 million of revenue to MeridianLink, or just over one-third of our revenue in the year-ago quarter. We expect the mortgage market to contribute only 24% of revenue for the first quarter of 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, our first quarter estimated adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $26.5 million and $27.5 million, representing EBITDA margin of approximately 39% at the midpoint of the range. For the full year 2022, estimated total revenue is expected to be between $288 million and $292 million compared to $267.7 million for the same period in 2021. This represents an estimated increase of 8% to 9% year over year. On a non-GAAP basis, our full-year 2021 estimated adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $112 million and $116 million, representing EBITDA margins of approximately 39% at the midpoint of the range. This lower year-over-year margin reflects anticipated increases in annual spending, as described earlier by Nicolaas, totaling approximately $15 million. As we've communicated previously, we will continue to invest in areas to drive future growth and the investment in sales and marketing to drive bookings, the investment in services capacity to convert bookings to revenue, and the investment in development and the cloud to both enhance and expand our product suite are all items that will require current expense that we expect will lead to future returns. Entering 2022, TCI and TazWorks have been part of our company for at least a year, so we will no longer be calling them out separately from our base. The normalization of activity in the mortgage lending market appears to be well underway. We expect this to be a minor headwind in lending software and a more meaningful drag on data verification software performance in the quarters ahead. Overall, the mortgage-related percentage of our revenue in 2022 is expected to decrease to the mid-20s, down from 30% in 2021. This reduction is less than previously anticipated as we have continued to add new mortgage LOS clients. Our existing clients have shown an ongoing ability to win market share in the tougher overall volume environment we are currently experiencing, and we are finding ways to augment our solutions with additional data items and partners to provide more value to our customers and, therefore, more revenue for ourselves. With that, Nicolaas and I are happy to take any of your questions. Operator? Operator Sure, sir. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Koji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple for me here. First one on Engage. Congrats on getting that generally available earlier this year. Just wondering with the release of Engage, would that cause any sort of sales cycle pause maybe from the end market trying to digest or fully digest what this new product is? And maybe any sort of color on what this Engage product could be replacing? Is it a greenfield opportunity? And any kind of uplift this new product could be for existing customers? Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Good afternoon, Koji, and thank you for your question. First of all, we've been communicating to the market that we would be launching in Q1, and we've seen a good success in the beta program in Q4, so we decided to bring to market and launch in January. Since then, we've seen great activity at top of funnel exceeding our expectations. And the sales cycle will continue to roll out, but it will turn into a booking, which will then move over to our operations group and be implemented in time and turn into revenue. From an opportunity standpoint, it's automation and analytics. It is, to a large extent, a greenfield opportunity in our customer base. There are some solutions available that have been available through our partner and marketplace but is not nearly as integrated and as real-time as the Engage offering that we've launched. And we're very excited about it. We've received great feedback to date from clients who have been testing it and add a lot of sales activity since launch in January. Koji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got it. Thanks, Nic. And then just one follow-up for me here. OK, so you ended the year with 50 quota-bearing reps. Thanks for that visibility there. And then it sounds like you guys are investing for growth. So just thinking about the QBR specifically, how should we be thinking about the pace of new capacity from here? And how is the hiring environment been for you? Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Let's start with the second part of the question. The hiring environment is pretty much as challenging as you can imagine, and I'm sure you're hearing it from other companies too. It's more challenging finding good skills today than it's been in my time with MeridianLink for more than 3 years. We do, however, keep finding talent. And when we bring talent onboard, invest on the onboarding and making our new employees part of the family, and train them as quickly as we can to be productive as new members to the team. In terms of ramping, the investments -- the way I would be thinking about the investments, we're sitting on a significant backlog, given the five, six quarters of outperformance in bookings and success. And the investments we're making in our services group is our highest priority investment in scaling. It's business that's contracted. It's in the bank. It's basically checks. We need to go cash. And to me, it's one of the low-risk investments you can make in today's market and climate and accelerate the business. And we're confident that it would yield a great ROI. Also, on the sales side, services being the larger part of the investment, but on the sales side, we continue to invest. But it's probably not going to be at the same clip you've seen over the last 12 to 18 months. But we find great opportunity. We continue to put more product into the field. Some of our lesser-known products, like our Collect product and our analytics products, for example, are getting more airtime and getting more focus. And then also from an Engage standpoint, lots of activity. So from my perspective, the focus is on services, but there's definitely a ramp on the sales side to kind of bring the two together. And by the end of 2022 have that pretty much in sync where the selling and the implementation isn't yielding a growing backlog anymore. Koji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got it, got it. Thanks, Nic. Appreciate the commentary. Thank you. Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer You're welcome. Thanks for asking, Koji. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Timothy Chiodo -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Great. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I have one just around general business and industry trends and then another, just a quick follow-up on the guidance and the incorporation of StreetShares. The first one is I know we've talked in the past about sometimes during an RFP process, you'll actually join forces with some of the large incumbent core banking platforms, the Fiserv, FIS, and Jack Henry's of the world. Just wondering if you've seen any kind of change in that trend if you're still seeing RFPs where you go together in joint to win business together and if you could just touch on that topic generally. And the quick follow-up is just around the guide. If you could just give any of the contributions that might be embedded from the StreetShares acquisition? Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Sounds good. I'll respond to the go-to-market RFP question, and I'll let Chad speak to the guidance question here. We still go to market where we are Switzerland to the cores. We believe that's our best positioning in the market, and we're happy to work with cores and integrating to cores and additional cores. We continue to work deals alongside cores in all the names you have listed. In fact, some of our larger opportunities are very tightly integrated sales initiatives where we and cores have partner and keep moving the deals forward and keep pushing an outcome together. So from my perspective, no change in that environment to date. Chad, do you want to speak to StreetShares? Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Tim, thanks for the question. So our guidance today doesn't include any impact of StreetShares. That deal was just announced. It has not yet closed. And when it does close and the timing of the close is known, we'll then be able to put it into the guidance. And we'll provide on our next call, presuming we close by that time, how StreetShares will be added to the view for the year. I would say that the acquisition itself is not material to the overall financial picture. So I wouldn't expect to see a material change in the financial guidance when we give it, but we certainly will incorporate it into the next update. Timothy Chiodo -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst That's excellent. Thank you for both of those answers. Really appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you for the questions, Timothy. Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please go ahead. Saket Kalia -- Barclays -- Analyst OK, great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Nicolaas, maybe just to start with you, kind of zooming out a little bit. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what your customers are saying about their consumer lending businesses right now amid sort of the rising interest rates. I think that consumer loans are going to be less rate-sensitive than mortgages, for example. But I'm just kind of curious, just broadly how your customers sound about those businesses currently. Does that make sense? Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer It makes sense. And good afternoon, Saket, and thank you for the question. I agree with you in terms of your perspective that consumer lending will be less rate-sensitive, and mortgages will be more rate-sensitive. And my perspective, given most of our clients are deposit-retaking institutions, they would welcome a more normalization of rates over time. And I actually believe and think they could be upside for our customers as nondepository competition will be facing rising cost of capital in a rising interest rate environment. So very much agree with the analysis that you've laid out. And I believe it will be a net benefit over time for the largest part of our customer base. Saket Kalia -- Barclays -- Analyst Got it, got it. That's helpful. That makes sense. Chad, maybe for the follow-up for you. I was wondering if you could just touch a little bit on gross margins a bit and kind of how you're thinking about those going forward. And maybe part of this is relating back to Nicolaas' point just on incremental services investment, which presumably will be going into the cost of goods sold line. But I was just wondering if you could touch on that a little bit, whether that started here in the fourth quarter. And maybe just zooming out on gross margins, as we start to see that mix shift next year and going forward between lending and data verification, can you just touch on whether there's a material gross margin difference between those two? Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Thanks, Saket. Appreciate the question. Touching on gross margins generally, we did see gross margins being slightly lower than our kind of long-term model in the fourth quarter and expecting that to continue into '22. And as you mentioned, a big component of that is that we will be augmenting our services capacity. And that capacity and those costs do flow through COGS as it relates to the services revenue. So we will see some bump in cost, therefore, a reduction in margin driven by the services. Now there will be services revenue attached to those investments as well. But the services revenue has a lower gross margin than the SaaS revenue does. Zooming out, like you said, we're looking at the mix shift, the SaaS margin, gross margin on data verification is lower than the SaaS margin on lending because we have the cost of the data elements of the data verification contained within the SaaS side. Conversely, there's less services on our data verification business than on our lending side. So there's not a real material difference ultimately on the gross margin between those two when you look at the overall mix of business. Saket Kalia -- Barclays -- Analyst And maybe if I could just sneak in one housekeeping question. Understanding that StreetShares hasn't closed yet. Is there anything that you can give us in terms of scale, whether that's revenue, whether that's number of employees? Anything that you can provide understanding that it still hasn't closed yet. Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Chad, is there anything you want to add to that? Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer No. We'll be giving that guidance once it's closed, Saket. So I would point you to there, obviously, StreetShares as a web page that talks about the business, that you can glean information about. But we're not looking to provide really any details until we get to close. Saket Kalia -- Barclays -- Analyst Got it. Fair enough. Thanks, guys. Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you for the questions, Saket. Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer I appreciate it. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Matt VanVliet with BTIG. Please go ahead. Matt VanVliet -- BTIG -- Analyst Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Maybe a bit of a maybe higher level question around sales activity as a follow-up to Saket's question. As the majority of your customers are depository institutions, even if rates aren't rising quite as quickly as maybe it looked like a few months ago, I think the overall trend certainly points to longer-term rates rising. So with that as a backdrop, are you seeing some of your customers or potential net new customers embracing the idea of investing in technology, especially in a bigger project undertaking like a lending system here? What's the overall appetite for spending balanced with ongoing uncertainty, whether it's from macro or even on the geopolitical side more recently? Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Good afternoon, Matt, and thank you for your question. We still find ourselves in a very opportunity-rich environment. Hard to gaze into a crystal ball to see what the ultimate impact of the conflict will be. But from our perspective and our midsized clients', they're in a cycle where there's a real need for technology refresh. And it's driven -- it kind of was coming from a digitalization kind of cycle perspective for them too. But with the pandemic that we've dealt with to date, those clients are realizing that the consumers' expectations have shifted away from being in branch transactional to much more digital from an interface and communication standpoint, where branches are becoming more an advisory base and knowledge base visit and not purely a transactional visit. So from a business model standpoint, it's evolving. And we help the mid-market stay competitive to larger Tier 1 banks and larger FIs. And our positioning to date is we are a platform. We consolidate a number of single-point systems into a platform where decisioning is real-time, where analytics is real-time, and automation is to your benefit. And in past analysis of how MeridianLink customers are doing compared to non-MeridianLink customers, our customers typically outperform non-MeridianLink customers in loan growth. So my perspective is as long as the environment don't significantly weaken or worsen, we will continue to have a productive selling motion in the company. And we've seen that over the last five quarters. And we're sitting on a backlog that we are scaling toward delivering, contracts are signed, and we've come off our best quarter in terms of new bookings. So from my standpoint, nothing has significantly changed. It feels like the tailwinds are the same and may even be picking up a little bit, given the strength of pipeline and kind of larger deals that we've seen percolate through our funnel. Matt VanVliet -- BTIG -- Analyst All right, very helpful. And then, Chad, as we look at -- you're talking about a little bit better-expected performance on the mortgage side embedded in guidance. I guess can you help us think about how some of those net new mortgage LOS customers might be impacting that versus the expectation of -- especially the refinance market probably cooling off further? And then how much, I don't know, of conservatism or potential downside risk have you stripped out of the guidance as we think about kind of where ultimately it shakes out by the end of the year? Thanks. Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Thanks, Matt. So on the mortgage side, as discussed, we are seeing -- the overall rate environment is having an impact on refinancings and those volumes. So we'll see those volumes roll through on the parts of our business that are tied to mortgage. So both on the lending side, the mortgage LOS and on the data verification side, whether we have the credit CRAs. But offsetting that decline in volumes is what you just referenced that we're doing. Obviously, we're having good success. It's a part of what Nicolaas talked about and the success in go-to-market and adding new mortgage LOS customers to kind of offset and defray what we're seeing in terms of volumes and then leveraging our relationship, our customers potentially gaining share as well as us finding new ways to add data and information into our credit reporting solutions to provide more value to our customers and, therefore, more revenue to us as we're actually able to pass that along in the form of more -- either having more of our partners added into our solutions or raising our own prices and pushing that through. So we think that that's -- we'd initially talked about in the past of seeing mortgage as a percentage of revenue going to the low 20s or teens. We're now expecting that to be in kind of the low to mid-20s for the year. And we think that's a conservative view, given where we see the market today. Matt VanVliet -- BTIG -- Analyst Wonderful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Schmidt -- Citi -- Analyst Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions here. I wanted to dig into the nonmortgage consumer LOS side. Can you talk about kind of the growth expectations embedded here for 2022? And then across the lending modules in the nonmortgage consumer LOS set, if you could just discuss perhaps where you're seeing the most demand, whether it's auto, card, personal, et cetera? Any color there would be great. Thanks a lot. Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer I would make the comment here. And Chad, if you want to step in where it's not a more high level, feel free to do that. But I would say, Andrew, we're living in an environment where we're performing, in my opinion, very well even with some of the headwinds, like supply chain constraints in auto and chips and new homebuilding material. And there's not a lone channel that I would say that really stand out in any way or shape. If you kind of follow what the market is saying or thinking about what shifts may happen, we're starting to hear our clients are looking and investing more in HELOCs as an example. But we really haven't seen that take off. I would say there's not an area that I would kind of highlight and say is worse on the consumer lending, mortgage, nonmortgage side to one another. It's kind of I think we're in a constrained world. Folks typically would initiate loans on assets and most of that we see or feel somewhat. My expectation is, and I don't have a crystal ball, that we're going to see '22 still being impacted by these constraints. Maybe things tend to ease up. You may have a better perspective than we do on it. But we, as a company, are doing everything that's within our control to maximize the opportunities for us, our clients, and the consumers. And whether it's investing in more integrations or assisting clients with better decisioning or better automation and marketing, whatever kind of helps us keep the flywheel moving for us and our clients, we have that control and we're doing it. But I don't have one channel that I would say is outperforming significantly over the other or another one that's kind of pulling everything down. It's worth in percentage points from trend lines of the past. Chad, is there's anything you want to add? Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, Andrew, the only thing I'd to add, as Nicolaas mentioned, is our expectation is that we see more of the same. So the impacts that we've seen through '21 on volumes on nonmortgage consumers were rolling forward. So anything that ultimately improves the market should be beneficial, but there's no expected big change to the up or the down, as Nicolaas mentioned. Andrew Schmidt -- Citi -- Analyst OK. Thats' very helpful. Thank you both for that. And then as a follow-up on MeridianLink One, it's good to hear about the progress. Maybe coming out of 2022 and into 2023, could you talk about just having that work substantially done, what that might mean for either net new or cross-sells? Just curious, at a very, very high level, can you remind us the potential benefits of bringing the platform together in a consolidated fashion? Thanks. Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Great question. From -- we are committed and on track to have migrated our private cloud environments over to public cloud, which ties in with our MeridianLink One platform and also integrating acquired products into our platform in a more meaningful way. We've done that with Saylent. We will continue to bring a platform to market where customers have the ability to acquire certain aspects of the platform as a new standing product, take, for example, mortgage. But the benefit is really the single user interface, the single sign-on, the analytics that can be done, the data that's made available between various components of the platform. And moving into 2023 from 2022, we will only be doing it in our public cloud environment. And the benefits for us and our clients would be it's more scalable. We have the ability to scale into markets we're not in today. We can implement and take clients faster in an environment where we just light up additional instances in the cloud. But also over time, as we think about our business and growth trajectory for the long term, being in that kind of environment with a platform where you don't need to put data centers down in markets you choose to go to but going through a cloud platform, that gives you the ability and kind of the benefit of speed when you launch. So it's a strategic initiative for us, putting MeridianLink One out there for our clients, completing the move, as well as ensuring that this is our baseline investment that from a technology architecture standpoint, that's going to carry us for the next decade or longer and positioning the company to roll in acquisitions that's cloud-ready faster, scale the platform faster. The benefits to us and our clients are clearly there. And the good news is from a selling and go-to-market standpoint, it will be easier. I think it will help us also create a more scaled sales force when we're in an environment where you can really take the platform forward. So I would say, very excited, very confident in our ability to complete the transition. We've seen and achieved a great milestone in Q4 with the move of a very large component over to our public cloud environment, this part of MeridianLink One, and that momentum will continue throughout the year. And it will set '23 up and the go-to-market motion and our ability to light up customers faster. It will just be an environment that we've wanted for quite some time and we eventually will be there, and we're very excited about it. Andrew Schmidt -- Citi -- Analyst Got it. Thank you for that. And clearly, a lot of benefits on the demand side. But it sounds like also on the cost side, there could be some capex savings as well as you kind of move away from in-house data centers. Is that the right way to characterize it? Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer You can think of it in the context of capex moving away. But at the pace, we are growing and just kind of a little bit of color, our growth between '19 and '20, new customer growth was slightly less than 20%. And our new customer growth between '20 and '21 was in excess of 30%. It's nearly doubled. So I would tell you as the cost for us to expand our data centers is not where we want to make the investment. So yes, there will be savings on that front. But I believe with the backlog we have and then also the momentum we're starting to see in our business, especially bringing on new logos and cross-sell, the ideas is the benefits are tied into faster scaling the ability to grow your footprint at an accelerated pace, the ability to bring acquisitions into the fold faster and make it part of the platform. And while the capex may drop off, there's going to be an increase in opex that will keep pace with the new customer wins and the cross-sell as we keep scaling. So I don't want to just think the one drops off and the other one is not really increasing. Chad, anything you want to add there? Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer No. You said it, Nicolaas. We'll be moving capex to opex. And so we will see the decline in the capex, the pickup in the opex. We're kind of having to double spin now as we have both the data centers and the cloud infrastructure that we're moving to. So through time, we hope to only have the cloud costs carrying us forward and be able to see the reduction in the capex and the spend we've had on maintaining our own data center infrastructure. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Sklar with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Alex Sklar -- Raymond James -- Analyst Chad, you mentioned in the prepared remarks the idea of the trade-off of higher monthly commitments in favor of lower pricing. Can you just talk about if you've seen any noticeable changes in your revenue visibility in the sense of kind of going back to your customers and kind of ramping up what their monthly commitments are compared to prior years? Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Thanks, Alex. So we have incrementally been working on moving customers to higher commitments in the contract process. For a number of these customers, they're already at a higher volume. So we're basically just locking in the revenue we're already receiving from these customers when we move them on to that committed construct. And for new customers, they're locked in at that commitment level. And then as their revenue grows through time, they may choose to step their commitment level up to receive lower pricing. But candidly, it's not been a big phenomenon of our customers looking to raise their commitments to take advantage of lower pricing. And the reality is -- but we have seen the revenue that is in that commitment category increase in light of bringing on these new customers and renegotiating existing contracts. So we have more revenue committed, but that commitment hasn't come really at the expense of having to take a much lower per app from each entity. Alex Sklar -- Raymond James -- Analyst Got it. OK. And then I don't know if Nicolaas or Chad want to take this one. But you talked a lot about the services backlog. And I'm just curious, given the revenue recognition model, how much of a leading indicator is that for logo growth or kind of what you can see in terms of accelerating subscription revenue growth in the end of '22 and '23? Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So the revenue recognition is we're not recognizing revenue from these customers until they go live. And their contract period doesn't start until they go live as well. So we're not losing any contracted revenue during the implementation phase. Just as Nicolaas talked about, the faster we can get the customer live, the sooner we'll be able to receive and recognize the revenue. And candidly, the customer is happier because they get access to the technology sooner. So as the investment in the services capacity to speed time to market, time to implementation really is a win-win-win for the customer, for us, and for both the services and the SaaS revenue streams. So that is an indicator. And so as we are successful in doing that, we should see more customers coming online going forward for -- but what Nicolaas was talking about around the success in signing new logos, right, that success is what's building that backlog. So the leading indicator of Nicolaas having the sales success is pushing entities into the backlog that we're now going to convert into revenue more quickly. Alex Sklar -- Raymond James -- Analyst Got it. That's very helpful color. Thank you. Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead. Bob Napoli -- William Blair -- Analyst Thank you, and good afternoon. Nice quarter. So just on the guide, big picture question. I guess long-term target EBITDA margins, 43% to 48%, and I understand you're investing a lot and you have a lot of momentum in the business. And you're focused on growth. But just any thoughts on the timing or the trend that -- or any goals you have in moving toward that long-term target? Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, Bob, thanks for the question. So yes, so the guide, obviously, for the year is right around or just shy of 40% on the EBITDA. We still think the long-term target absolutely makes sense for us. We've talked about the investments we're making. We've talked about the impact on '22 on gross margin from the services investment we're making. But again, the ROI on that is, as Nicolaas said, cashing the checks. So that's positive. And then we think as we mix -- the mix moves more to SaaS, as the services move those entities into our SaaS revenue, we should see both the gross margins improve, which drag along the EBITDA margins, and also just converting the spend on R&D and sales and marketing. I talked about kind of the amount that we're spending on a year-over-year basis. Again, all of that is really to push and accelerate revenue. And when the SaaS revenue comes on at a higher margin, that will certainly, through time, pull us to the margins that we're targeting. Bob Napoli -- William Blair -- Analyst Thank you. And then, I guess, impressive 30% growth in new customers in '21. That's a nice acceleration. Is that -- I mean are you -- it seems like it's been -- the demand just broadly in the bank tech space and the fintech that you've seen, we've seen a lot of demand. But have you seen from your customer base a more aggressive posture and maybe this is a post-COVID posture in realizing the need for digital? And I know you've ramped up your marketing investment somewhat specific to you. But are you seeing a mindset change that's driving that? And is there a change in the ARR per customer? Are you adding larger customers? Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Let me speak to the mindset. We definitely see an increased level of interest in our target segment of the market to invest in future technology. And I do believe the pandemic at a point in time paused and have folks to rethink what the business should look like for the next decade or longer. And not because I know what MeridianLink is investing in and doing, but I really believe we're at the right place at the right time with the right platform for the mid-market, and what we do resonates. We're not the cheapest solution in the market. And we're not a stand-alone solution that companies need to invest dollars and integrate across their technology landscape. We bring a platform that they can run a large portion of their business on. And financial institutions that are forward-thinking want to be more engaging with the broader customer base, tend to engage in various levels of interactions and discussions with us. Some may start with doing a whole bunch of webinars, learning more what we offer. Eventually, it turns into demos. We end up nurturing discussions and working with clients. And I think it's a mindset that we're starting to see where folks realize they can actually grow their business faster if they're more efficient if they have better access to data and they can make decisions faster in their business for their clients. And they also are starting to get to the point where they can offer the most competitive rates as they work with MeridianLink and analyze risk better in that whole cycle. So from my perspective, we resonate with a market segment that wants to serve their clients better, wants to outperform competitors who are not been investing to date yet. And our offering is, again my opinion, the market-leading offering with the integrations we have, the breadth of the platform, and how we accelerate and have these mid-market financial institutions kind of outperform non-MeridianLink fintechs. So the way I would think of it is, yes, people are starting to think about what the business is going to look like post-COVID, what should they be doing to attract new customers, new clients, new members and how can they be competitive in a world that has shifted and changed, where the branch isn't performing the same function that historically did before COVID. And when I speak to prospects when we connect with clients that are buying incremental MeridianLink solutions, that is certainly one of the most prominent themes of the discussion is just thinking about where the business will be in a year or two from now and even longer-term. Bob Napoli -- William Blair -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Appreciate the answers. Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Bob, I would just add one comment. Yes, I would add one comment, which is I don't think we're noticeably seeing an increased ARR on new logo sales, right? We typically lead with consumer LOS, and then Nicolaas talked about how we're adding additional functionality and growing ARR through time. But I will say, we have focused on really kind of pruning the small end of our customer base, some of the smaller customers that came through the acquisitions we've done in the past year-and-a-half. And really, that's leading and you'll see that we're just having a higher ARR per customer as a result of that. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Parker Lane with Stifel. Please go ahead. Parker Lane -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Thanks for taking the question. Sort of a follow-up to the last one. If you just look at the overall SaaS spend of the financial services sector, I think you've highlighted that as a real tailwind in your business over the last few years. In the context of a more uncertain macro and thinking back to the company's history, what have you seen from these institutions in the face of an uncertain macro? Do you think there's any potential for them to perhaps pare back their spending? And then secondarily, what are some of the competing interests here? Are there places that they're looking to digitally transform where MeridianLink is trying to get in there and be the priority of choice for those customers as they think about the next digital transformation project they're taking on? Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Chad, do you mind taking that one for a second? Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, no problem. Parker, I would say at a macro level, right, we're still seeing the trend of these institutions investing in technology. The depository institutions, there's still pressure from the neo banks, from the fintechs, from all the start-ups who are looking to propagate their new solutions. And so our customers, right, the community banks, the credit unions are very focused on keeping up in that marketplace. So we haven't seen any slowdown. And historically, even when times or looking farther back in time, even in difficult periods around more economic uncertainty, often that's the time that then folks are looking to turn to technology to find ways to attract customers to make better lending decisions. And again, our solutions basically help these entities attract deposits, basically attract lending, right, make loans and get interest income on those loans. And that's 80% of their top line. So having a solution ready to go out in a difficult market and find and continue to ensure that they're driving their top-line performance is something that we -- that's a conversation we relish having even if the overall environment gets a little bit more difficult. Parker Lane -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Got it. Appreciate the feedback, Chad. Congrats on the quarter. Chad Martin -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks. Operator Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'll now turn the call back over to our CEO, Nicolaas Vlok, for closing remarks. Nicolaas Vlok -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, operator, and thank you to all those who have joined us today for our first full-year review of our performance as a public company. And I'm really excited about our outperformance in this first year being public. And what I said earlier is it's even more remarkable, given the pressure from supply chain constraints and a normalizing mortgage environment, which, again, from my perspective, highlights the tremendous strength of our consumer lending business and also the opportunities ahead of us. As we look ahead, I am confident that our investments in 2022 will position us extremely well to continue to scale and accelerate the business. I'm looking forward to when these headwinds subside and, in fact, become tailwinds for us and as we are ideally situated to grow our market-leading position. In the meantime, we are confident we can deliver another year of strong revenue growth with best-in-class profitability. And lastly, I want to thank our amazing employees and our loyal clients who trust us and inspire us to be better every day. We've had an exciting week, and I'm looking forward to closing out our acquisition of StreetShares here. And I would love to officially welcome the team, the StreetShares customers, and their partners to the MeridianLink family. And thanks again. It's what I can say for your commitment to being on our call today. Really appreciate you joining, and have a great afternoon, evening, wherever you may be at. Operator?

MeridianLink, Inc. stock traders use a variety of tools to make a prediction on which way the MLNK market is likely to head next. These tools can roughly be divided into indicators and chart patterns. When trying to make a MeridianLink, Inc. stock forecast, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall. Moving averages are among the most popular MeridianLink, Inc. stock prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for MLNK stock over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for MLNK is a sum of MLNK\u2019s closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12. In addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action. 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the stock market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the MeridianLink, Inc. stock price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for MeridianLink, Inc. stock. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually interpreted as a negative forecast for the MLNK market. Traders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the MeridianLink, Inc. stock price. When making a MeridianLink, Inc. stock forecast, most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of MeridianLink, Inc. stock with different granularity \u2013 for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremely short-term price action or choose a weekly candlestick chart to identify long-terms trends. 1-hour, 4-hour and 1-day candlestick charts are among the most popular. Let\u2019s use a 1-hour candlestick chart as an example of how this type of price chart gives us information about opening and closing prices. The chart is divided into \u201ccandles\u201d that give us information about MeridianLink, Inc.\u2019s stock price action in 1-hour chunks. Each candlestick will display MLNK\u2019s opening price, closing price, as well as the highest and lowest prices that MeridianLink, Inc. reached within the 1-hour period. This information makes it easier to make an informed price prediction. It\u2019s also important to pay attention to the color of the candle \u2013 a green candle means that the closing price was higher than the opening price, while a red candle tells us the opposite. Some charts will use hollow and filled candlestick bodies instead of colors to represent the same thing. Just like with any other asset, the price action of MeridianLink, Inc. stock is driven by supply and demand. These dynamics can be influenced by fundamental factors, such as earnings announcements, new product launches, acquisitions and mergers, and other factors. The MLNK stock price can also be influenced by market sentiment, broader economic conditions, interest rates, inflation rates and political developments. Some traders try to identify candlestick patterns when making stock price predictions to try and get an edge over the competition. Some candlestick formations are seen as likely to forecast bullish price action, while others are seen as bearish.

        "Extracted Text": "The average incident takes nearly three hours to resolve and rising costs of incidents are largely compounded by lack of automation 90% of IT leaders reported that outages or disruptions have reduced customer trust in their organization These are some of the results from a study of 500 IT leaders and decision-makers of companies with more than 1,000 employees responsible for IT operations from the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, that highlights the growing impacts of customer-facing incidents and the ways automation can help mitigate. (Graphic: Business Wire) LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PagerDuty On Tour - PagerDuty, Inc. (NYSE:PD), a global leader in digital operations management, today released a study of 500 IT leaders and decision-makers of companies with more than 1,000 employees responsible for IT operations from the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, that highlights the growing impacts of customer-facing incidents and the ways automation can help mitigate. The findings illustrate the significant length and cost of incidents: the average incident takes nearly three hours to resolve (175 minutes) while the estimated cost of downtime is $4,537 per minute, meaning each incident can cost nearly $794,000. As respondents\u2019 organizations saw an average of 25 high-priority/priority incidents in the last 12 months, the cumulative costs add up to just under $20 million per year, per organization. \u201cDigital incidents occur, and front-line responders are too often hindered in their ability to resolve incidents quickly due to fragmented IT environments, inadequate processes and inability to identify the right responders\u201d \u201cPagerDuty\u2019s global survey found that incidents have been driven by increased complexity, rapid expansion of digital services and insufficient investment in IT infrastructure maintenance,\u201d said Eric Johnson, chief information officer at PagerDuty. \u201cThe costs of these incidents are significant both financially and in lost consumer trust, which is why companies need to invest in automation to mitigate the risk and shorten the time an incident lasts. Investing in automation needs to be at the top of IT leaders\u2019 priority lists.\u201d Other key findings of the data include: Digital incidents continue to rise in number, last longer and cost more, but organizations are also understanding the critical role automation can play. 86% of IT leaders surveyed say that their organization is making strides towards fully automating the end-to-end incident response process. \u201cDigital incidents occur, and front-line responders are too often hindered in their ability to resolve incidents quickly due to fragmented IT environments, inadequate processes and inability to identify the right responders,\u201d said Jeffrey Hausman, chief product development officer at PagerDuty. \u201cAutomation can be a key enabler in achieving resilience in these increasingly complex environments. With automation built into the PagerDuty Operations Cloud, businesses can streamline repeatable, critical work across incident response and service management to reduce the staggering financial costs of incidents.\u201d The survey was conducted online between May 31, 2024 and June 6, 2024 by Censuswide on behalf of PagerDuty.

Digital operations management specialist PagerDuty (PD 2.66%) reported fiscal 2025 third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, Nov. 26, that topped estimates. The company's non-GAAP EPS of $0.25 exceeded both analyst projections of $0.17 and management's guidance of $0.16-$0.17. Revenue also outpaced expectations, totaling $118.9 million against the estimated $116 million, reflecting a 9.4% year-over-year increase. Despite areas for potential improvement, such as an ongoing operating loss, the quarter was overall positive with advancements in enterprise market expansions and product innovation. SOURCE: PAGERDUTY. NOTE: ANALYST CONSENSUS ESTIMATES PROVIDED BY FACTSET. MANAGEMENT EXPECTATIONS BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S GUIDANCE, AS PROVIDED ON SEPT. 3, 2024. YOY = YEAR OVER YEAR. GAAP = GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. PagerDuty provides clients with a comprehensive digital operations management platform, empowering organizations to manage real-time incident responses and optimize workflows. Its robust suite of tools enables rapid detection, investigation, and resolution of operational issues. Focusing on enterprise and mid-market clients, PagerDuty\u2019s growth strategy revolves around expansion and new product developments, particularly integrating AI capabilities into its offerings. A pivotal element of its business strategy is its substantial investment in product innovation, ensuring the platform remains competitive and adaptable. PagerDuty's key achievements in Q3 include a 9.4% year-over-year revenue uplift to $118.9 million. This growth aligns with its strategy of expanding its enterprise footprint, leveraging effective land-and-expand sales models. Operating income stood out with a non-GAAP figure of $25 million (21% of revenue) compared to $15 million in the prior year, driven by streamlined operations and effective cost management. While the company reported a $10.3 million operating loss, non-GAAP adjustments emphasized a healthier financial position. Additional accolades include PagerDuty\u2019s recognition as an AI Operations leader by GigaOm, highlighting its innovative AI-powered features. These developments solidified its standing in a competitive market, supported by ongoing investments in research and development. Despite the positive financial results, challenges lingered. The decline in dollar-based net retention rate from 110% to 107% signals a potential challenge in upsell activities, but robust annual recurring revenue growth of 10% to $483 million provided a stabilizing counterbalance. Management has offered an optimistic outlook for PagerDuty\u2019s fiscal trajectory, raising full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance to $0.78-$0.79, up from prior projections of $0.67-$0.72.

        "Extracted Text": "The cloud stock jumped on a better-than-expected earnings report. Shares of PagerDuty (PD 2.66%) were shooting higher today after the cloud-based network-monitoring software maker posted better-than-expected results in its fourth-quarter earnings report and offered strong guidance for the current year. As of 12:42 p.m. ET, the software stock was up 18%. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. PagerDuty said revenue in the fourth quarter jumped 32.4% to $78.5 million, outpacing estimates at $76.1 million. Dollar-based net revenue retention increased 124%, an improvement over 121% in the quarter a year ago, showing that existing customers increased their spending by 24%. Total paid customers increased 7.5% to 14,865, but the company experienced much faster growth with higher-value customers. For instance, customers with annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $100,000 or more increased from 426 to 594, and customers with ARR of more than $1 million rose from 26 to 43, showing the company is gaining customers with larger budgets and ramping up its existing relationships. On the bottom line, the company's adjusted loss per share narrowed from $0.06 to $0.04, which beat estimates at $0.06. CEO Jennifer Tejada said: \"Driven by ongoing market traction for our new products and strong go-to-market execution, Q4 results capped a fiscal year of accelerating growth for PagerDuty. We delivered revenue of $79 million for the quarter and $281 million for the year, both growing 32% year over year, and gained operating leverage which positions us well for durable growth.\" Looking ahead, PagerDuty's guidance also impressed the market as the company expects revenue growth of 28%-30% to $360 million-$366 million, ahead of the consensus at $352.7 million. On the bottom line, the company sees an adjusted loss per share of $0.17 to $0.23, which compared to the average estimate at $0.19. Its first-quarter outlook was also better than expected as the company forecast revenue growth of 28%-31% to $81.5 million-$83.5 million, compared to expectations at $80.2 million. On the bottom line, PagerDuty called for an adjusted loss per share of $0.08 to $0.09, which was worse than analyst estimates at $0.06. Following its recent acquisition of Catalytic, the company will expand its exposure to no-code automation software, which should help it bring more customers up to higher ARR levels, a key growth driver. At a price-to-sales ratio of 10, PagerDuty still looks well priced for the sector. Jeremy Bowman owns PagerDuty. The Motley Fool owns and recommends PagerDuty.

When trying to make a PagerDuty stock forecast, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall. Moving averages are among the most popular PagerDuty stock prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for PD stock over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length.

If the PagerDuty stock price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for PagerDuty stock. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually interpreted as a negative forecast for the PD market. Traders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the PagerDuty stock price. When making a PagerDuty stock forecast, most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of PagerDuty stock with different granularity \u2013 for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremely short-term price action or choose a weekly candlestick chart to identify long-terms trends. 1-hour, 4-hour and 1-day candlestick charts are among the most popular. Let\u2019s use a 1-hour candlestick chart as an example of how this type of price chart gives us information about opening and closing prices. The chart is divided into \u201ccandles\u201d that give us information about PagerDuty\u2019s stock price action in 1-hour chunks. Each candlestick will display PD\u2019s opening price, closing price, as well as the highest and lowest prices that PagerDuty reached within the 1-hour period. This information makes it easier to make an informed price prediction. It\u2019s also important to pay attention to the color of the candle \u2013 a green candle means that the closing price was higher than the opening price, while a red candle tells us the opposite. Some charts will use hollow and filled candlestick bodies instead of colors to represent the same thing. Just like with any other asset, the price action of PagerDuty stock is driven by supply and demand. These dynamics can be influenced by fundamental factors, such as earnings announcements, new product launches, acquisitions and mergers, and other factors. The PD stock price can also be influenced by market sentiment, broader economic conditions, interest rates, inflation rates and political developments. Some traders try to identify candlestick patterns when making stock price predictions to try and get an edge over the competition. Some candlestick formations are seen as likely to forecast bullish price action, while others are seen as bearish.

        "Extracted Text": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amplitude, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMPL), the leading digital analytics platform, today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \"We are on the path to reaccelerating growth,\" said Spenser Skates, CEO and co-founder of Amplitude. \"Product innovation is the biggest driver of long-term value for Amplitude. Our platform continues to evolve to serve more users, more workflows, and more outcomes. Customers see that and are turning to us for our integrated and easy-to-use experience.\" Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights: (in millions, except per share and percentage amounts) Third Quarter 2024 Third Quarter 2023 Y/Y Change Annual Recurring Revenue $298 $273 9% Revenue $75.2 $70.6 6% GAAP Loss from Operations $(20.0) $(20.9) $0.9 Non-GAAP Income (Loss) from Operations $1.6 $2.8 $(1.2) GAAP Net Loss Per Share, Basic and Diluted $(0.14) $(0.15) $0.01 Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Share, Diluted $0.03 $0.05 $(0.02) Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $6.2 $8.0 $(1.8) Free Cash Flow $4.5 $7.5 $(3.0) Non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share exclude expenses related to stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Stock-based compensation expense and the related employer payroll taxes were $21.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $23.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Free Cash Flow is GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software costs. The section titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below contains a description of the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations between historical GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables below. Third Quarter and Recent Business Highlights: Financial Outlook: The fourth quarter and full year 2024 outlook information provided below is based on Amplitude\u2019s current estimates and is not a guarantee of future performance. These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d section below for information on the factors that could cause Amplitude\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. For the fourth quarter and full year 2024, the Company expects: Fourth Quarter 2024 Full Year 2024 Revenue $76.0 - $77.0 million $297.1 - $298.1 million Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss) $(2.1) - $(0.1) million $(6.3) - $(4.3) million Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Share $0.00 - $0.01 $0.04 - $0.06 Weighted Average Shares Outstanding 134.9 million, diluted 131.7 million, diluted An outlook for GAAP income (loss) from operations, GAAP net income (loss), GAAP net income (loss) per share and a reconciliation of expected non-GAAP income (loss) from operations to GAAP income (loss) from operations, expected non-GAAP net income (loss) to GAAP net income (loss), and expected non-GAAP net income (loss) per share to GAAP net income (loss) per share have not been provided as the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP income (loss) from operations, GAAP net income (loss) and GAAP net income (loss) per share cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for stock-based compensation expense requires additional inputs such as the number and value of awards granted that are not currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP adjustment for amortization of acquired intangible assets depends on the timing and value of intangible assets acquired that cannot be accurately forecasted. Conference Call Information: Amplitude will host a live video webcast to discuss its financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024, as well as the financial outlook for its fourth quarter and full year 2024 today at 2:00 PM Pacific Time / 5:00 PM Eastern Time. Interested parties may access the webcast, earnings press release, and investor presentation on the events section of Amplitude\u2019s investor relations website at investors.amplitude.com. A replay will be available in the same location a few hours after the conclusion of the live webcast. Forward-Looking Statements: This press release contains express and implied \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding the Company\u2019s financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, the Company\u2019s growth strategy and business aspirations and its market position and market opportunity. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cpredict,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201ccontinue,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cseek,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cprojection,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d and \u201coutlook,\u201d or the negative version of those words or phrases or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not statements of historical fact, and are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about the Company\u2019s industry as well as certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond the Company\u2019s control. These statements are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results, performance, or achievement to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the statements, including risks related to: the Company\u2019s limited operating history and rapid growth over the last several years, which makes it difficult to forecast the Company\u2019s future results of operations; the Company\u2019s history of losses; any decline in the Company\u2019s customer retention or expansion of its commercial relationships with existing customers or an inability to attract new customers; expected fluctuations in the Company\u2019s financial results, making it difficult to project future results; the Company\u2019s focus on sales to larger organizations and potentially increased dependency on those relationships, which may increase the variability of the Company\u2019s sales cycles and results of operations; downturns or upturns in new sales, which may not be immediately reflected in the Company\u2019s results of operations and may be difficult to discern; unfavorable conditions in the Company\u2019s industry or the global economy, or reductions in information technology spending, which could limit the Company\u2019s ability to grow its business; the market for SaaS applications, which may develop more slowly than the Company expects or decline; the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights, which may not protect its business or provide the Company with a competitive advantage; evolving privacy and other data-related laws; and the impact of new sanctions related to Russia on the Company\u2019s ability to collect receivables. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are or will be included under the caption \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in the reports and other documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the Company\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q being filed at or around the date hereof. The forward-looking statements made in this press release relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this press release to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures: This press release includes financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating the Company\u2019s ongoing operational performance. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company\u2019s financial results with other companies in the industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under GAAP. For example, other companies in the Company\u2019s industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. In addition, Free Cash Flow does not reflect the Company\u2019s future contractual commitments and the total increase or decrease of its cash balance for a given period. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the Company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below. Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP Gross Margin, Non-GAAP Operating Expenses, Non-GAAP Income (Loss) from Operations, Non-GAAP Operating Margin, Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), and Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) per Share: The Company defines these non-GAAP financial measures as their respective GAAP measures, excluding expenses related to stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and non-recurring costs such as restructuring and other related charges. The Company excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, which is a non-cash expense, from certain of its non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. The Company excludes amortization of intangible assets, which is a non-cash expense, related to business combinations from certain of its non-GAAP financial measures because such expenses are related to business combinations and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Company\u2019s business. Although the Company excludes these expenses from certain non-GAAP financial measures, the revenue from acquired companies subsequent to the date of acquisition is reflected in these measures and the acquired intangible assets contribute to the Company\u2019s revenue generation. The Company excludes non-recurring costs from certain of its non-GAAP financial measures because such expenses do not repeat period over period and are not reflective of the ongoing operation of the Company\u2019s business. The Company uses non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share in conjunction with its traditional GAAP measures to evaluate the Company\u2019s financial performance. The Company believes that these measures provide its management, board of directors, and investors consistency and comparability with its past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin: The Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software costs. Free Cash Flow margin is calculated as Free Cash Flow divided by total revenue. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow margin are useful indicators of liquidity that provides its management, board of directors, and investors with information about its future ability to generate or use cash to enhance the strength of its balance sheet and further invest in its business and pursue potential strategic initiatives. Definitions of Business Metrics: Annual Recurring Revenue The Company defines Annual Recurring Revenue (\u201cARR\u201d) as the annual recurring revenue of subscription agreements, including certain premium professional services that are subject to contractual subscription terms, at a point in time based on the terms of customers\u2019 contracts. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, and does not represent the Company\u2019s GAAP revenue on an annualized basis, as it is an operating metric that can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. ARR is also not intended to be a forecast of revenue. Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate The Company calculates dollar-based net retention rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from the cohort of all customers as of 12 months prior to such period-end (the \u201cPrior Period ARR\u201d). The Company then calculates the ARR from these same customers as of the current period-end (the \u201cCurrent Period ARR\u201d). Current Period ARR includes any expansion and is net of contraction or attrition over the last 12 months, but excludes ARR from new customers as well as any overage charges in the current period. The Company then divides the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the dollar-based net retention rate (\"NRR\"). The Company then calculates the weighted average of the trailing 12-month dollar-based net retention rates, to arrive at the trailing 12-month dollar-based net retention rate (\u201cNRR (TTM)\u201d). Paying Customers For purposes of customer count, a customer is defined as an entity that has a unique Dunn & Bradstreet Global Ultimate (\u201cGULT\u201d) Data Universal Numbering System (\u201cDUNS\u201d) number and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. The DUNS number is a global standard for business identification and tracking. The Company makes exceptions for holding companies, government entities, and other organizations for which the GULT, in the Company\u2019s judgment, does not accurately represent the Amplitude customer or the DUNS does not exist.

Amplitude (AMPL -0.12%) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Nov 07, 2024, 5:00 p.m. ET Yaoxian Chew -- Vice President of Investor Relations Hello, everyone. Welcome to Amplitude's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. I'm Yaoxian Chew, vice president of investor relations. Joining me are Spenser Skates, CEO and co-founder of Amplitude; and Andrew Casey, chief financial officer. During today's call, management will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, the expected performance of our products, our expected quarterly and long-term growth investments, and our overall future prospects. These forward-looking statements are based on current information, assumptions, and expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these statements. Further information on the risks that could cause actual results to differ is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we assume no obligation to update these statements after today's call, except as required by law. Certain financial measures used on today's call are expressed in a non-GAAP basis. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to facilitate analysis of our financial and business trends and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be used in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between these GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release, which can be found on Investor Relations website at investors.amplitude.com With that I'll hand the call over to Spenser. Spenser Skates -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Yao. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our 2024 third-quarter earnings call. I'm going to focus on three sections today. First, Q3 financial results and what we're seeing in the market; second, how we are going after our market opportunity; third, Command AI, continued product innovation, and customer stories. I'm pleased to report that we beat all guided metrics this quarter. Our third-quarter revenue was $75.2 million, up 6% year over year. Annual recurring revenue was $298 million, up $8 million from the end of the second quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $1.6 million or 2.1% of revenue. We now have almost 3,500 paying customers. In Q3, customers representing $100,000 or more of ARR grew to 567, an increase of 13% year over year. We put up a better quarter, thanks to execution. This quarter's results are especially encouraging when taking into account the unexpected headwinds from the new Russian sanctions that we discussed on last quarter's call. Here are the highlights. Our integrated platform approach is uniquely suited for this moment. Customers are looking to us to drive consolidation. Today, 23% of our annual contracted customers use more than one of our products. Our competitive position remains strong, particularly against point solutions and legacy players. One callout this quarter is Google Analytics, whose customers are dissatisfied with its persistent usability problems and unresolved privacy issues. This is creating a long tail of opportunities for Amplitude. We are building a higher-quality book of business. Last quarter, I spoke to promising signals across pipeline and attach rates. We believe the nature of larger sales is changing for the better as we make progress to win the enterprise. We are starting customer conversations differently, reaching key decision makers, and demonstrating fast value in ways we weren't before. We saw continued healthy growth in our $100,000 or more ARR customer base and a stronger mix of multiyear deals this quarter. It's worth noting just how different the nature of these deals is compared to the wins we're seeing a couple of years ago. We delivered several million-dollar-plus expansions, the majority of which were multiproduct wins. I am again encouraged by the continued green shoots that we have been calling out. Cohort health continues to improve. Newer customer cohorts are demonstrating healthier gross and net retention patterns. Customer utilization is showing stability quarter to quarter. We are entering Q4 with strong enterprise pipeline and feel confident in our ability to execute. I've said that ARR and revenue reacceleration are both well within our reach. This quarter sets us firmly on that path. While we are making progress, there is still plenty of work to do. We are past the significant majority of overbought to optimization contracts, but churn is still too high. The macro environment is still choppy. Buyer scrutiny remains high, especially for larger deals. Digital natives remain on the defense, while M&A and layoffs are an unpredictable variable impacting end-user demand. Next, I want to share a quick update on the team. We hired Wade Chambers as chief engineering officer. Wade has an incredible perspective on what a great engineering organization looks like at scale and will bring that to Amplitude. I've talked to many leaders across Silicon Valley who consider Wade to be the best engineering leader working today for this stage of company. Most recently, he was the CTO and SVP of engineering at Included Health. Previously, he led engineering at Twitter, Teleparty, Proofpoint, Yahoo, Opsware, and NetScape. Wade has been an advisor to Amplitude for eight years, and I have learned a huge amount from him. He has a courageous and first principles approach to tackling tough challenges. His ability to build and run high-functioning teams will enable us to drive execution at scale. I am thrilled to be working with him. Moving to product updates. We had a big launch with Amplitude Made Easy in September as part of WinSimple. We rebuilt the Amplitude platform to make it easier for new users to get started. We are now offering users a single line of code to get up and running, auto-capture and visual tagging, default dashboards out of the box, and bundling of Session Replay and experiment SDKs. We've already begun our enterprise rollout following encouraging signals in our self-service motion. New self-service sign-ups have increased by 40%. We've also seen a 40% increase in new organizations who are sending data per week. Session replay activation has more than doubled as a result of these changes. We are reducing data friction, widening the top of funnel, and encouraging multiproduct behavior. Our mission is to help companies build better products. Our thesis is that analytics is positioned to be the center of gravity for workflows that touch customer and product data. Without analytics, the rest of the stack is much less useful. Amplitude's platform continues to evolve to serve more users, more workflows, and more outcomes. To win the digital analytics category, we need to deliver the data and insights customers need and help them take the actions that will drive acquisition, growth, retention, and expansion. We see immense opportunity for AI to let us deliver more customer value. There are two areas of near-term focus. The first is automated insights, which we can surface to customers proactively without human intervention. The second is automated actions, where Amplitude can recommend and take actions that we know will improve the end customer experience. More on these to come at a future date. Our recent Command AI acquisition accelerates this ambition. Teams around the world use Amplitude to gain a deeper understanding of user behavior and build great digital experiences. However, customers are often asking us for more. They want a way to take action to influence or learn more about the trends they're uncovering with their analysis. Command AI does this through form factors like guides to help with onboarding, messages to share in-app announcements, and the ability to get user feedback in real time through surveys. Command AI provides intuitive AI-powered user assistance to makes complex software easier to adopt and navigate. Their product offers in-product nudges and tours, onboarding guides, and surveys delivered in a way that resonates with users rather than annoying them like these tools all too often do. Command AI's user-focused approach helps create a customer journey that is personalized and unobtrusive. Users love it because it sets them up to be successful. Companies love it because they can encourage the behaviors they want and help users find value faster. In all our strategic conversations with Command AI, it was clear that there would be strong strategic and cultural fit. Their No. 1 position in the G2 Digital Adoption Platforms ranking is strong validation of market momentum. Their Amplitude integration was already one of their most popular integrations they offered. Everything they do is more powerful when combined with our platform capabilities. Analytics and cohorting add context and targeting for guides. Experiment lets users test which interventions and messages are the most effective. Session replay ties user feedback to in-product behavior. These are just a few examples of the power of behavioral data driving the right actions. We expect to release an integrated experience early next year. Product and behavioral data is important to everyone in the organization. We extended our partnership with HubSpot this quarter, allowing teams to combine the power of HubSpot with Amplitude's customer behavior data. With this latest integration, go-to-market teams can easily track product usage alongside traditional CRM data. Customers can see Amplitude charts in their HubSpot dashboards and target customer cohorts based on product usage or other key buying signals. Teams can also bring HubSpot data into Amplitude to understand marketing campaign performance. Our own product-qualified leads at Amplitude convert better than the average, and we're excited to bring that power into hundreds of joint customers. Lastly, we continue to grow our platform with the launch of Web Experimentation. A/B testing tools are often difficult to use in scale requiring engineering resources. They lack flexibility and introduce page slowness, which impacts conversion rates. With Web Experimentation, Amplitude now offers a self-serve way to easily run A/B tests across product features and websites. Visual editing and point-and-click interaction reduces the need for engineering support. We are making it easy for product managers, marketers, and growth leaders to A/B test and personalize web experiences. Turning to customers. In Q3, we landed and grew with customers like realtor.com, Playrix, DigitalOcean, Fanatics Commerce, Traveloka, ONAG, Philips, Radio France, Joe & the Juice, and Thomson Reuters. We saw continued success this quarter displacing multiple point solutions as customers look to us to drive vendor consolidation. Realtor.com helps millions of home shoppers find their dream home. They provide a comprehensive list of for-sale properties nationwide as well as information and tools to make informed real estate decisions. Amplitude began working with the realtor.com product team three quarters ago. We delivered fast value by unlocking behavioral insights, democratizing data access, and helping the team ship the right experiences faster. Our initial success helped raise awareness that we could solve larger problems across the organization. Realtor.com was looking to streamline access to data with a single unified view of the customer journey to generate actionable insights and better meet consumer needs. By supporting a simplification of Realtor's digital tech stack, we are reducing friction and increasing trust between the marketing, analytics, and product organization. This win speaks strongly to the opportunity ahead for Amplitude. Our growing platform breadth, combined with an increasing pull outside of our core product persona shows that Amplitude can be the single pane of glass for our customers' digital needs. We also grew an ongoing partnership with a major global sports organization this quarter. They say that personalized fan experiences are a priority, advancing them toward their goal of 100 million paying subscribers, which in turn, drive billions of dollars in broadcast rights. Over six years, Amplitude has grown steadily from powering their direct-to-consumer arm to a far more strategic deployment across the organization. Usability, scalability, and cost frustrations with their legacy MarTech providers had reached a breaking point. In contrast, Amplitude gave their marketing and product teams a shared and unified view of the customer journey to test strategies, target audiences, and tailor content. This quarter, they are going all in with every part of our digital analytics platform as part of a three-year agreement. Our footprint across their organization continues to grow as we are being implemented across dozens of teams and subsidiary leagues. We believe this marks the start of a larger shift in workflows of their legacy MarTech providers toward Amplitude. Their forward-thinking approach is great validation of our platform vision. We see many similar situations out there and think this can open more opportunities for MarTech replacements with other enterprise clients. DigitalOcean, a leader in cloud services, has partnered with Amplitude to revolutionize their marketing and product-led growth strategies. DigitalOcean is looking to build an entirely new muscle in product-led growth. Previously, DigitalOcean relied on a just jointed toolkit, Looker for reporting on Snowflake and Pendo for user insights. This required data analyst work, which limited both broader team accessibility and the ability to take action. By consolidating on to Amplitude, DigitalOcean has been able to streamline their processes, eliminate fragmentation, and enable comprehensive data analysis. DigitalOcean aims to derive specific insights related to user onboarding, feature adoption, and engagement metrics. With Amplitude, they can more efficiently analyze user behavior on their cloud platform and pinpoint bottlenecks and onboarding flows to enhance the user experience. I've been very intentional about repeating these three statements. First, our thesis is that analytics is the center of gravity for any workflow that touches customer and product data. Second, product and behavioral data is important to everyone in an organization. Third, product innovation is the biggest driver of long-term growth and shareholder value for Amplitude. Nothing has changed about our long-term opportunity. We remained well positioned to win the category as the convergence of buyers and budgets across product, marketing, and experience continues. We have a unique position to be the platform leader that drives continued consolidation of fragmented tooling and legacy offerings. I've said before that we are going to drive reaccelerating growth for Amplitude regardless of the macro environment. We are on that path, and we'll keep executing with urgency. We are not here to build a single-digit growth business. Thank you for your interest in Amplitude. I'd now like to turn it over to Andrew to walk you through the financial results. Andrew Casey -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Spenser, and thanks to everyone joining us today. I'm happy to report that we exceeded all guided metrics this quarter. Now that I've had some time to work with the team, I'm happy to share that many of my early instincts about the business have been proven right. Amplitude has the right product focus to meet critical business needs and a customer-obsessed culture focused on solving difficult problems. Our platform is uniquely set up to win against the market backdrop of vendor consolidation and the convergence of product, marketing, and experience analytics. We haven't quite turned the corner yet, but the signs are there. Cohort health continues to improve, and we are building a higher quality book of business, making progress on our efforts to win the enterprise. Our platform is growing with new product capabilities and our customer use cases, but there is more to do. As part of my first official earnings call with Amplitude, I'd like to share some overarching financial principles. Hopefully, none of these comes as a surprise. First, we are not a growth at all cost company. We are investing appropriately to drive accelerating growth while generating positive free cash flow. And we plan that our growth will come with leverage. There are caveats. We deal with capital allocation decisions every day, and we may adapt this approach when we have attractive opportunities that drive long-term value at the expense of short-term results. Now, turning to our third quarter results. As a reminder, all financial results that I will be discussing with the exception of revenue are non-GAAP. Our GAAP financial results, along with a reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found on our earnings press release and supplemental financials on our IR website. Third quarter revenue was $75.2 million, up 6% year over year and 3% quarter over quarter. Total ARR increased to $298 million exiting Q3, an increase of 9% year over year and $8 million sequentially. Here are more details on key elements of the quarter. New ARR was largely expansion-driven this quarter. As Spenser mentioned, we had several expansions that exceeded seven figures. Linearity was more pronounced than normal in the quarter as our mix of enterprise business continues to grow. The number of customers representing 100,000 or more of ARR in Q3 grew to 567, an increase of 13% year over year. In-period NRR was 98% and NRR on a trailing 12-month basis is 97%. Large expansions contributed to the better-than-expected result. Gross margin was 77% for the third quarter, down two percentage points year over year and up one percentage point quarter over quarter. The sequential margin increase was driven primarily by optimizations with our hosting services. Sales and marketing expenses were 43% of revenue, flat year over year. Sales efficiency is not where we'd like it to be, and we are focusing at driving improvements, investing against increasing proof points to better enable our enterprise success. G&A was 16% of revenue, up two percentage points year over year, reflecting increases in legal expenses and bad debt expenses related to new Russian sanctions. G&A also needs to improve as a percentage of revenue over time. Total operating expenses were $56 million, up 7% year on year. We had previously estimated a negative impact to operating profit of $4 million due to new Russian sanctions. The actual net impact ended up being closer to a negative $3 million. Operating profit was $1.6 million or 2% of revenue, which represents a two-percentage-point decline on a year-over-year basis. Net income per share was $0.03 based on 131.3 million diluted shares compared to net income per share of $0.05 with 128.1 million diluted shares a year ago. Free cash flow in the quarter was positive $4.5 million or 6% of revenue compared to $7.5 million or 11% of revenue a year ago. Now, let me take a moment to talk about our philosophy as it relates to mergers and acquisitions. There are three questions we always ask ourselves for every opportunity we look at. First, can we accelerate our strategy through what we're buying? And are we better together? Is there a strong long-term cultural fit? And does this make financial sense? Elements of our product strategy always involve a buy versus build decision, and we will continue to balance both, all in the service of building a more robust platform. Now, turning to outlook. We are assuming that the macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging in the near future. Every new logo remains tough, and buyer scrutiny remains high. We think caution continues to be warranted. Stabilization is simply not enough. We believe that every incremental point of market share in this stage of the cycle will be magnified on the recovery. We plan to reinvest appropriately against our platform opportunity, and we will not shy away from making big bets where we see favorable outcomes. We are reinvesting against increasing proof points to better enable our enterprise success. On gross margin, we believe we have the ability to drive continued efficiencies with our hosting providers over the medium term. However, any material expansion will likely be offset with continued investments we're making in professional services, especially for larger enterprise customers. All numbers and guidance include the impact of the Command AI acquisition and associated fees. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to be between $76 million and $77 million, representing an annual growth rate of 7% at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP operating loss to be between a negative $2.1 million and negative $0.1 million. And we expect non-GAAP net income per share to be between $0.00 and $0.01, assuming diluted shares outstanding of approximately 134.9 million. For the full year, we are raising our full-year revenue outlook to be between $297.1 million and $298.1 million, an annual growth rate of 8% at the midpoint. We are reducing our outlook for non-GAAP operating loss to be between negative $6.3 million and negative $4.3 million. We expect non-GAAP net income per share to be between $0.04 and $0.06, assuming shares outstanding of approximately 131.7 million as measured on a fully diluted basis. I'm confident in our ability to drive long-term growth to a level above where we are today. Our long-term opportunity remains incredibly compelling. With increased discipline and execution, I believe we're in a great position to capture it. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Over to you, Yao. Yaoxian Chew -- Vice President of Investor Relations Great. Please turn on your microphone and camera. Limit yourself to one question and one follow-up in the interest of time. Our first question comes from Koji Ikeda from Bank of America, followed by Brent Bracelin from Piper. Koji, go ahead, please. George McGreehan -- Analyst Thanks, guys. This is George McGreehan on for Koji. I wanted to start out with kind of a bigger picture question just about with all this talk of AI agents and how they're becoming more powerful and maybe we'll see one day where they become so fully functioning that they can interact with apps on their own. I kind of wanted to ask, in a world like that, how does Amplitude play into kind of capture kind of the interactions that the AI apps or AI agents have with apps? Spenser Skates -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, we're talking a very different world from the one that we live in today. I'll give you kind of two different views as to how we plan. So, I think first is, there's always some interface between the human world and the digital world. And our thing is, how do we capture all those touch points and help companies make those experiences be the best they possibly can be? So, even with agents, there's a point where you're asking them to go do something. If you look at any of the trends for times humans spend interfacing with digital, the stuff is just continuing to go up and to the right. And so, even if you're delegating more and more tasks to agents, in net, I expect humans will spend more time -- more and more time interfacing with the digital world. And so, that's just a great thing for us. The second opportunity I'd like to call out with respect to AI agents is a little more -- and this is like exactly how is it going to play out, but that one of the really exciting things about our position in that world is we have this enormous repository of data of customer behavior, one of the largest. And so, if you think about, OK, we get to train that on not just humans, but AI agents in that world and help figure out, OK, well, how can you make an AI agent more successful in this digital experience or this digital interface versus one where you're not tracking that? And so, like we think of it as like, hey, we instrument a digital product journey and whether it's a human using it or an AI using it, you want to maximize that as a company no matter what. George McGreehan -- Analyst Makes sense. Can I ask one, too, just in terms of where are you guys -- could you give a little bit more color perhaps on where you guys are seeing room for incremental investments, kind of what's giving confidence there, just kind of in regards to revenue guide going up and pro forma operating income guide going down a bit? Spenser Skates -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, obviously, we did the Command AI acquisition, which is driving the bulk of the change in guidance on operating income side. As we go into next year, I'd say the biggest place we want to continue to invest is in product innovation. And so, that means continuing to build the teams, continuing to -- so that we can ship a lot of stuff and be on the bleeding edge there. There are tons of things customers are asking us for. That's why a big part of why we did the Command AI acquisition is because customers were asking us for this sort of functionality, we want to be able to deliver it. And so, I expect us to continue to be very aggressive with getting new products and innovation out to market, and we'll grow the team commensurate with that. On the go-to-market side, we've made the investment that we need to make. And so, what we're going to be looking to do is drive reacceleration through Q4 and 2025 with roughly the level of investment and the headcount that we have. The places that we'll make adjustment is we'll continue refocusing that motion more and more upmarket to the enterprise side over time while automating the low end of the market with self-service and either fully or semi-automated ways. Yaoxian Chew -- Vice President of Investor Relations Great. Thank you. Next question, Brent Bracelin from Piper, followed by Matt Pryde from Citi. Brent, go ahead, please. Brent Bracelin -- Analyst Thank you, guys. A quick question here for me. First one is going to be around the Command AI. Could you talk a little bit about -- it sounds like you had an integration with them existing. How much overlap, customer overlap was there with that platform? And could you just quantify like the revenue opportunity there? A typical customer might spend $85,000 in Amplitude. Could it provide -- if you bundle both, could it provide a 10%, 20%, 50% uplift? I'd love to better understand the overlap and economics. And one quick follow-up for you, Andrew. Spenser Skates -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, I think Command AI gives us two big new opportunities from a product standpoint and then one additional thing on the AI front. So, the first is guides and the second is surveys. And so, doing those in the forms of interacting back with your customers is very valuable to tie with our analytics. And I think I expect over the long term, yes, a majority of our accounts could use this sort of functionality with the analytics. Now, in terms of uplift, it's early to say, but you could easily see 20%, 50%, potentially more depending on the criticality of that functionality to your business. The other thing I'll call out on the Command AI side is actually their user assistant product, which we're really excited about, which is basically an end user like it's an agent that exists to help the end users of our customers. So, you have this thing that pops up on the website that says, \"Hey, what do you want to do and then it figures out how to guide you through the experience and you can interact with it in different ways, to help you get things done on the product. And they've actually -- so even though that's a new product for them in the last year, they've actually seen the most growth from that new product. So, I expect this is going to be a big part of our offering in the same way that we expect experiment and Session Replay and a whole bunch of other stuff to be as well. Andrew Casey -- Chief Financial Officer Maybe just one add-on to that. The -- Brent, the Command AI acquisition was really one that brought great product capabilities and a great team. There was very little revenue overlap. And it's a very small company, but they had such a great offering that when we did our analysis, it was very clear that it was much better for us to bring them on as part of the team than try to go build that ourselves. So, we -- it will absolutely be a better-together story. Brent Bracelin -- Analyst Certainly makes sense. And then just for you, Andrew, as you think about net new ARR, pretty healthy in light of some of the headwinds you had relative to some of the Russia contract changes there, the distributor. You mentioned it was mostly on the expansion side. Why now? Why do you think you saw some big expansions? I mean, the last time I think we talked, you were a little more nervous around renewals and downsizing, and we've seen that kind of pressure on NRR for the last -- better part of the last couple of years. What changed? Andrew Casey -- Chief Financial Officer I think this is where Spenser was talking about earlier, we made investments early on this year about moving more and more of our sales coverage to enterprise clients. We're introducing more and more product capabilities. And that better together value for the money, driving greater efficiencies in their operations really made sense to a number of our existing clients, and they trusted us and we earned the right to have those expansions. Now, I think that we need to have more of that. We need to be broader with our customers. We need to see more of customers who are recognizing Amplitude as the consolidator in the market. So, we've got our work cut out for us. But definitely is very positive in that respect. It's just got to be broader. Spenser Skates -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Brent, just to give you one example, the Realtor contract that we did, typically in the past, that would have taken us a few years to get that point. Because we built relationships with the chief marketing officer, chief product officer, and head of data at Realtor, we were able to accelerate that from a few quarters from the first trial deployment to a full end-to-end deployment across multiple products. And so, I attribute that back to the focus on win the enterprise and the execution there and the great things that Thomas and folks across the board in go-to-market have been doing to be able to drive that expansion to do the one with the global sports league, to do a lot of the very larger ones that we did this past quarter. Now, as Andrew said, we certainly have our work cut out for us in terms of replicating and scaling that as we go into Q4 and 2025 but some great early proof points. Brent Bracelin -- Analyst Very helpful. Thank you. Yaoxian Chew -- Vice President of Investor Relations Great. Next question, Matt Pryde from Citi, followed by Arjun Bhatia from Blair. Matt, go ahead, please. Matt Pryde -- Analyst Hey, guys. Thanks so much. I was wondering if we could just dig into the increase in operating loss expectations and if that should be a normal cadence like heading into next year. Andrew Casey -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Matt. I'll take this one. Matt, I would tell you that what really colored our guidance change on op loss was related to assuming the operating expenses associated with Command AI, the deal-related expenses, and some of the ongoing legal expenses we have with outstanding lawsuits. That's really the predominance of the change. Matt Pryde -- Analyst Got it. And last quarter, you mentioned that your average deal size in the pipeline was up about 25%. I guess, in terms of the size of the deals, has that changed at all in the most recent quarter? In terms of the size of deals that you're seeing in the pipeline? Andrew Casey -- Chief Financial Officer Well, I would tell you that we talked about the number of deals that we saw that were over seven figures in the quarter. So, that should tell you that when we've seen that earn right to expand with clients, they're rewarding us with those larger deal sizes. So, I think that that speaks to the potential of our ability to execute in a broader sense with our customers and drive those big deal sizes. Matt Pryde -- Analyst Got it. Thank you. Yaoxian Chew -- Vice President of Investor Relations Great. Next, Arjun Bhatia from Blair, followed by Nicholas Dannewitz from Scotia. Arjun, go ahead, please. Unknown speaker -- William Blair -- Analyst This is Willow on for Arjun Bhatia. So, I'm going to start off with the self-service A/B testing and Web Experimentation announcement, how are you monetizing this product? And how has early customer reception been? Spenser Skates -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer So, it's very similar to our other products out there. We're directly selling it. We've already seen some deals that have been closed even though Web Experiment has only been out for about a month at this point. I think the key thing with Web Experimentation is very friendly for marketers and growth teams. And so, teams that might not have access to engineering resources to make coding changes where they can just point and click on a website in order to run an A/B test. So, we've already monetized it in our -- in a few of our enterprise deals. And I think it's kind of great combination with our traditional server-side experimentation and feature flagging. Unknown speaker -- William Blair -- Analyst Gotcha. And then one more question if I may. Can you comment on the competitive environment? Has there been changes? Are you seeing new players you haven't traditionally seen like marketing players, for example? Spenser Skates -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer It's been -- so I'd repeat the themes that I've been talking about the last few quarters, which is that both versus the legacy MarTech players as well as versus the point solutions, there is a drive toward consolidation and a drive toward buying the next-generation stack. And so, we -- part of the reason that we're being so aggressive with launching these other products, Web Experimentation, the Command AI acquisition, we just -- we're going to be getting out Mobile Session Replay soon is because there is a lot of asks for consolidation from our customer base, where they want to use all the same provider, and they want to standardize on whoever they've chosen for analytics, which is us. And so, I think the one callout I'd say that's a little bit more interesting this quarter is we see a lot of increased dissatisfaction with Google Analytics 4, where a lot of customers -- of their enterprise customers have been forced to use that for the first time for the last quarter in Q3, and they're realizing the lack of depth, as well as a whole bunch of issues around the privacy side, makes it so that they have to go find something else, and that's where they ended up talking to us. Unknown speaker -- William Blair -- Analyst Thanks for taking our questions. Spenser Skates -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Great. For sure, Willow. Yaoxian Chew -- Vice President of Investor Relations Next question from Jackson Ader from KeyBanc, followed by Elizabeth Porter from Morgan Stanley. Jackson, go ahead, please. Jack Nichols -- Analyst Hey, guys. This is Jack Nichols on for Jackson Ader. I wanted to touch on if you guys could talk about how contract renewals are coming in relative to your expectations. Spenser Skates -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer I think -- so we are past the significant majority of the optimization from 2021 and 2022. So, that's been great, and we expect to -- there's still a tail of them and -- but that's continuing to reduce as we go into Q4 and 2025 as far as the visibility we have. I think newer cohorts also tend to be healthier, both on gross and net dollar retention. So, that's good. But I would caveat that overall, we are not happy with where renewal rates are at and need to continue to make progress as we go through 2025. And as we do that will naturally lead to acceleration of the business. One, a big part of our -- like me talking a lot about when the enterprise is to focus away from SMB and mid-market customers, where you have a lot of tech start-ups that, frankly, are not doing well, and so the renewal rates are adversely impacted. Jack Nichols -- Analyst Great. That makes sense. And maybe as a follow-up, can you talk about kind of the levers that you can pull to increase the sales efficiency that you guys were talking about earlier on the call? Spenser Skates -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer So, I think as I was saying on an earlier question, I think it will naturally as a result of -- like we've built out the team that we need to. And then as we go into Q4 and 2025, an acceleration on the top line will naturally lead to a whole bunch of metrics there improving. Did you want to comment on that as well? Andrew Casey -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. I think it's a natural evolution of how a sales force when increasingly focused on an enterprise motion is invariably, those sales cycles are longer, so you have to be a little bit more focused on delivering and proving out your value over a period of time. We're also introducing a lot of new product capabilities that are augmenting an increasingly stronger value proposition and a better together platform story. And the sales team is getting more and more adept at demonstrating that to new and existing clients who maybe didn't think about Amplitude to solve some of those really complex problems in the past. So, I think this is one where we have to be diligent. We have to be focused. We have to be -- want to have a little bit of patience as we get better and better at that execution. Spenser Skates -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Actually, just to be really clear on that, one of the big drivers that we're going to focus on in 2025 is adoption of the full platform. We are at 23% multiple product adoption, which great progress, but we need -- I want to get that to 100% because we see those customers are much stickier in terms of the renewal rates. They buy way more. They get to much higher ASPs. There's just a lot more value created from buying the whole platform. So, that's going to be a really big focus of ours. Jack Nichols -- Analyst Thank you, guys, for answering. Yaoxian Chew -- Vice President of Investor Relations Great. Next question, Elizabeth Porter from Morgan Stanley, followed by Clarke Wright from D.A. Davidson. Elizabeth, go ahead, please. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask on the Command AI acquisition. It sounds like there has been a lot of disruption in the space also with WalkMe kind of taken out. So, I just wanted to get your view on how ripe this market is for consolidation and what the go-to-market process looks like there. Spenser Skates -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Very, very ripe for consolidation. The reason we did it is -- the reason we did this acquisition is because the -- our customers have been asking us for a consolidated solution. It makes no sense to run a stand-alone tool, whether that be WalkMe or something else. They'd much rather integrate it on one platform, not just because there's lower cost of ownership, but because you can target users a lot better. So, if you have the analytics data, you know when and where to send a nudge or a pop-up to the user as opposed to just kind of blanket spamming your entire customer base. So, yes, I think we're going to see quite a bit of adoption of it as we launch it next year. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to touch on the pipeline. Understanding there's still two months left in the year, kind of how would you characterize the pipeline thus far heading into 2025 relative to the year-ago period? Spenser Skates -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer It's early to call it out for 2025. I'd say Q4, we're entering with strong pipeline. So, that's good to see. Obviously, a bunch of work on the execution front to convert it. And the early signals that we see in Q1 and Q2 are similar, but it's early to say exactly where we'll land. I do want to call out like from a pipeline standpoint, we are in a much better spot than we were a year or two ago in terms of the repeatability of our processes and also in terms of the enterprise amount. I think before we were kind of bucketing everything all in the same where you'd have SMB and mid-market pipeline be like, oh, we hit our pipeline number when actually not high enough percentage of it is quality enterprise pipeline. And we've since changed that. And so, there's a much, much stronger enterprise pipeline. Elizabeth Porter -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Yaoxian Chew -- Vice President of Investor Relations Great. Last question, Clark Wright from D.A. Davidson. Go ahead, please, Clark. Clark Wright -- Analyst Thanks. So, a quick question in terms of the long-term RPO number, accelerated to 49% year over year. That's pretty astonishing given kind of the buying environments and what you're talking about. Would love to kind of maybe dig into that and what you're seeing, if it's more of the long-term commitments by the enterprises or if it's directly an outcome of your enterprise go-to-market motion changes. Is there anything to call out there? And then I'll have one follow-up. Andrew Casey -- Chief Financial Officer So, I can take that one, Spenser. It absolutely is a result of the focus we've had on building stronger, deeper relationships with clients aligning our contracts to how customers view their value accretion over a period of time. Enterprises buy in very different ways than SMB and mid-market do. They don't consider a new vendor or an existing vendor for those types of contracts without having really understood how best to partner with them to drive that long-term value. And for us, it's one that we want to do that as well with our clients because it enables us to have, as you surmised, a much better view on the long-term revenue. It gives us greater predictability. And I think it gives us a lot of confidence that we're doing things in the right way, especially since most of those contracts, those customers have bought into the full platform. Clark Wright -- Analyst Got it. And then just following up, are you assuming anything in terms of 4Q from IT budget flushes? Or does that represent potential upside? Andrew Casey -- Chief Financial Officer I wouldn't say we've geared our guidance based upon any form of expectations on budget flushes. Clark Wright -- Analyst Got it. Thank you. Yaoxian Chew -- Vice President of Investor Relations Great. With that, I'm seeing no further questions in queue. Thank you very much. We know it's a very busy night for earnings. We appreciate so many of you joining the call today. We will be in RBC Capital Markets Global TMT Conference in November and at the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference and the Scotiabank Global Technology Conference in December.

(AMPL -0.12%) Q3 2022 Earnings Call Nov 02, 2022, 5:00 p.m. ET Yaoxian Chew Hello, everyone. Welcome to Amplitude's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call.

With that, I will hand the call over to Spenser. Spenser Skates -- Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Thank you, Yao. Good afternoon, everyone. Tuning in for our Q3 2022 earnings call. Amplitude delivered a strong third quarter. We closed with $61.6 million in revenue, up 35% year over year. This was above the high end of our guidance. We are also delivering strong operating leverage and raising our margin outlook for the year, thanks to our disciplined investment approach. Dollar-based net retention was 123%. We now have more than 1,900 customers. For those of you joining us for the first time, Amplitude helps companies build amazing products, drive growth, and win their categories. We are a digital analytics platform that gives self-service visibility into the entire customer journey. With Amplitude, teams can understand what product features are working, where users are getting stuck, and what actions lead to the right outcomes. Nothing is more critical to driving digital revenue growth. Our land performance in Q3 was exceptional. It was our best land bookings quarter in Amplitude's history. New Amplitude customers include Zillow, Fox Broadcasting, Volkswagen, Volaris Airlines, Shell, and Ably. We also had several large six-figure wins. Our customers tell us that Amplitude delivers better ROI than their existing solutions. We can provide insights that were not possible with other means, and our self-service approach is more scalable. However, the macroeconomic environment has clearly shifted. This quarter was more challenging with regards to expansion and churn, and we expect these dynamics to persist through 2023 as our customers try to navigate the sudden whiplash from the pandemic to 2021 highs, to current macroeconomic weakness. We want to work with them to ensure their success. Hoang will provide more details on how the environment will temper our growth expectations in the near term. Against this, I'm confident that the need for digital analytics will drive long-term durable growth for Amplitude's business. Our unique approach to analytics at the behavioral level resonates deeply with our customers. We continue to gain share in our early growing market. When it comes to product data, companies are in the first inning. I speak with data leaders all the time, and I consistently hear from them that they're only 5% or 10% of the way toward completing their vision for leveraging customer data at their companies. That includes some of the most sophisticated technology companies who are on Amplitude. We are helping shape an early category of software. We're seeing some signs that were even earlier in the category than we initially thought. Many of our new customers are digital natives who are already familiar with product-led growth, yet they still need Amplitude to understand their customer journey and build better product experiences. Companies have spent a fortune for teams of data scientists and data engineers. Stopgap in-house tools, and frustrating legacy analytics solutions. The most common result is tedious data breadlines, where the entire organization is blocked on access to data by a few analysts. This means teams do not have an understanding of their customers, lack appropriate context for decisions, and are unable to build winning products. Amplitude's technology and self-serve approach gives organizations data that's trustworthy and robust enough to run their business on and that everyone can use. This unique combination enables customers to run their business in a data-driven way at scale. Improving your data helps you build an amazing product, drive growth, and win your category. BeReal, the social network app that went from 10,000 daily active users to tens of millions of daily active users in 18 months expanded its work with Amplitude in Q3 in order to keep up with its rapid growth. Data is a central part of BeReal's culture. Almost all of its employees are in Amplitude daily. Alexis, their CEO, told me he spends several hours in Amplitude every day. For fundraising, he shows an Amplitude dashboard instead of a standard pitch deck because it shows how engaging his product is. BeReal's expanded use of Amplitude will help the team improve the product experience so more of their users create a daily habit. Companies don't just work with Amplitude because of where our product is today. They work with us because of how quickly our product gets better. We outship and out-innovate everyone in the space, and we are fanatical about being responsive to customer needs. We released more than 30 new features in Q3. They're all aimed at helping companies make more informed decisions faster. One of the features I'm most excited about is cart analytics. Typically, a user's product behavior and their purchase behavior on different systems. Amplitude brings this together cohesively. This lets teams analyze performance down to the SKU level and discover opportunities for product combinations and cross-sells. We also launch starter templates to give users a better out-of-the-box dashboard experiences and new integrations with Slack and Miro to bring key metrics to the collaboration tools that our users live in every day. These updates are all about making it easy for anyone to benefit from Amplitude. Data tables, which we talked about last quarter, has already become one of the most top five used features in Amplitude. This is a great example of us leading with first-to-market innovation. We're the only digital analytics vendor with this type of multidimensional analysis. Finally, we're also doubling down on our core and product analytics. First, we're investing in design and user experience to extend Amplitude's ease of use and accessibility. Our goal has always been to make Amplitude's No. 1 ranked product analytic solution, the essential platform for product data, engineering, and growth leaders alike. These new investments will help every potential user, regardless of technical know-how. We want everyone to be able to crawl, walk, and then run with our digital analytics platform. Second, we're making significant engineering investments to help customers track data more cost effectively and extend our structural cost advantage over our peers. We hear our customers' concerns in a cost-conscious economic environment and desire to track large volumes of data in a cost-effective manner. We are also investing in greater transparency to help our customers better track usage and drive confidence for scale. We believe this approach, combined with continued product innovation, will make Amplitude even more valuable. Amplitude's CDP, which went GA at the end of August, has well-exceeded internal expectations. It's still too early to give you more specifics, but this is an important part of our platform value proposition and approach to innovation. CDP will make it easier to get up and running with Amplitude and remove duplicative spend for our customers. Experiment now includes support for low latency use cases by local evaluation and real-time monitoring to improve test outcomes. Better performance for customers means more iterations, more tests, and better results. We continue to see strong external validation for Amplitude's leading position in the market. We're mentioned in Gartner's Hype Cycle for Customer Experience Analytics report. And Amplitude ranked No. 1 in nine categories in the G2 Fall 2022 report, including No. 1 in product analytics for the ninth quarter in a row and No. 1 in mobile app analytics for the fourth quarter in a row. We also ranked No. 3 in digital analytics for the seventh quarter in a row. Amplitude was also recognized as an insights and analytics category leader in Snowflake's inaugural Modern Marketing Data Stack Report. We have hundreds of joint customers driving significant value using our Snowflake integrations, and we'll be continuing to focus on deepening this partnership. Our go-to-market evolution continues with new experienced leadership. As part of this evolution, I am thrilled to welcome Tifenn Dano Kwan as our new chief marketing officer. Tifenn was previously CMO at Collibra and Dropbox, and she held numerous marketing leadership roles at SAP, including a CMO of SAP Ariba and a SAP Fieldglass. We knew Tifenn was the right leader for Amplitude because she has an amazing track record for driving product line growth, expanding pipeline, and building strong teams. I'm excited to have her onboard. As we continue to add leadership, we're focused on improving our execution across go-to-market, including improved approaches to sales operating cadence, pipeline hygiene, accurate quarterly forecasting, better enablement, detailed inspections of top accounts with more engagement and accountability, and value-based selling. These are all muscles that we are building so that our go-to-market strategy and efforts can match a world-class product. I'm pleased with the progress the team is making and the results they delivered this quarter. While we have many of the ingredients in place, our path to greatness here will not be done overnight. We'll continue to invest in and grow our organization to get us there. Numerous deals this quarter were catalyzed by changes in Google Analytics. I think it's important to clarify why Amplitude is superior as more companies move over. At its core, Amplitude's focus is always on product and growth workflows. We give the most critical insights into the entire customer journey. This is different from Google Analytics, which only focuses on marketing workflows. Technologically, we built the propriety columnar database that allows us to perform complex distributed joints. This means we can deliver behavioral insights on what drives growth in ways that other systems can't. Our customer data infrastructure layer also ensures data easily comes in, unifies, and stays high quality. Our customers can then take action on these insights, making better product decisions through data-driven experimentation and audience activation. Customers who have moved also tell us we had a significant edge in collaboration and usability. Amplitude works better for casual data users and expert analysts alike. New business trends remain encouraging. While there's greater scrutiny on buying decisions, product analytics continues to be seen as a must-have. Data and analytics continue to rank high in the spectrum of IT prioritization. There's growing appreciation of Amplitude's unmatched ROI and a widening opportunity set for competitive replacements. In addition to some of the big wins I mentioned earlier, other Q3 lands include Teladoc, Holiday Inn Club Vacations, and H-E-B Grocery. We also had notable customer expansions in Q3, including NerdWallet, BeReal, Miro, MaxRewards, and AllTrails. I'm going to share a few customer stories from the third quarter that show what drove some of these wins. One of the Q3 wins I'm most excited about is Zillow, the most visited real estate website in the United States. After using a page-based analytics solution for years, the Zillow team decided to work with Amplitude to better report and measure the full online and offline customer journey. This sets up Zillow to achieve two big goals. First to expand the data-driven culture that it's been building for years. With Amplitude, over 200 product and marketing team members will be able to ask and answer critical questions without having to write a sequel, without having to wait for data scientists to get an answer for them. Second, Zillow wants to connect their app and website to buying a home. They want to know what features a customer used that drove them to make a transaction. Amplitude will help the Zillow team's surface trends connect specific features to those outcomes and continue to innovate. A part of the Volkswagen group, Elli, is creating a holistic energy and charging experience for electric car drivers and dealers. Until now, the team had little understanding of how customers were using its apps, what features were working, or whether users were getting stuck. In Q3, Elli started working with Amplitude Analytics to establish a more data-driven product management strategy for its three white-label apps. With Amplitude, the Elli team will be able to track user conversion rates, validate user journey hypotheses, and ultimately increase app subscription rates. Brainly, the most popular education app in the world, with more than 300 million users, started working with Amplitude last year. With a cross-platform view of its customer journey, Brainly discovered that people who use its instant answers feature at least five times are far more likely to buy a subscription. With this insight in mind, the Brainly team adjusted the product experience to make this feature more accessible and as a result, increased free-to-paid conversions. Now, Brainly is expanding its work with us to include Amplitude experiment. Its team has always had a culture of experimentation, but now, its nontechnical teams will be able to set up product tests and analyze outcomes at a much faster pace. While it will be challenging for the near term, I view this time as an incredible opportunity for Amplitude. Our digital analytics platform is getting better every day. We are even earlier than we thought in our markets. Our customers love us and want to do more with us over the long term, and we have the flexibility to play offense to set us up for long-term success. We have done a lot in the one year since becoming public. We've won more than 500 new customers and announced our biggest set of product launches in company history. We are investing in our people. We are building a world-class team, and we are setting the foundation for sustainable, durable growth. You know, at a recent company All Hands, I asked our team what is the most important determinant of long-term success. What I told them is that persistence trumps everything else. How long do you stick on something day after day, month after month, year after year? While it has been an eventful year in the public lands, it's also been an eventful decade since our founding. We've been hard at work here at Amplitude since we started this company 10 years ago, and I expect to be hard at work for decades to come. Thank you for your interest in Amplitude. I now like to turn it over to Hoang to walk us through the financial results. Hoang Vuong -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Spenser, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. Third quarter revenue was $61.6 million, up 35% year over year. Customer count was also up 35% year over year to 1,913. Dollar-based net retention was 123%. In the third quarter, we flexed our superior product position and strong execution to deliver our best land booking quarters ever. We signed numerous large deals, thanks to our go-to-market and product teams. They did a tremendous job in highlighting competitive differentiation in showing how Amplitude helps our customer build amazing products, drive growth, and win their categories. It is also worth mentioning that more than a quarter of our land in Q3 had Google Analytics as the incumbent solution. We started 2022 with a goal of driving longer-term contracts and attaching new products. We're excited to see more large customers signing multiyear deals. We also crossed a significant milestone of 10 million in ARR from both experiment and audience products in just one year. This is strong validation and execution of our strategy, especially in this macroenvironment. We mentioned the potential headwinds in the economy during our last earnings call, and we saw the following specific impact in Q3. Expansion bookings were lighter than expected as some of our customer business load and budget scrutiny remain elevated. We saw higher churn from small businesses who were unable to pay and partial churn increase as customer rightsized due to budget or utilization. If we look past the near-term headwinds, our growth vectors have not changed. We will work to continue to acquire new customers around the world, expand across our existing customer base, and extend our product leadership in an early and underpenetrated market. We are confident that we can continue to navigate this environment and come out even stronger. We're seeing results from prior investments and managing the business for long-term sustainable growth. We're in a great position to stay aggressive and win the digital analytics category. Geographically, revenue from the U.S. increased 26% year over year to 37.4 million in Q3, or 61% of total revenue. International revenue increased 52% to 24.2 million or 39% of total revenue. As a reminder, we invoice primarily in U.S. dollar. So, the strength of the dollar does not have an FX impact on revenue, but it does have a negative impact on new business. Total RPO increased to $248.1 million, up 63% year over year. Current RPO also increased to $183.9 million, up 46% year over year, or approximately 74% of total RPO. Our strong growth in RPO benefited from a steady increase in multiyear deal. Next, I'll be discussing non-GAAP results for Q3 going forward. As a reminder, our GAAP financial results, along with a reconciliation between GAP and non-GAAP results, can be found in our earnings press release and supplemental financials on our IR website. Gross margin was 74%, up more than 300 basis points year over year. We saw upside to gross margin this quarter with us achieving another credit from our hosting provider. We expect to continue to operate in the range of 71% to 74% in the near term. Turning to operating expenses in a quarter. Sales and marketing expense was 45% of revenue, compared to 43% of revenue in Q3 2021. R&D expense was 23% of revenue compared to 19% of revenue in Q3 2021. As planned, we continue to hire across all function at the more measured pace that we had planned for. Our strong discipline delivered an operating loss of $4.9 million or negative 8%, beating our guidance of negative 16% to 17%, and compared to a loss of $2.3 million or negative 5% in Q3 2021. Net loss per share was $0.03 based on 112 million shares, compared to a loss of $0.05 with 39.3 million shares a year ago. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $306.6 million at the end of Q3. Note, this now includes $59.4 million in U.S. Treasury bonds classified as noncurrent. Free cash flow was negative $3.9 million or negative 6% of revenue, compared to negative $15.8 million or negative 35% of revenue in a year-ago period. As a reminder, last year, cash flow included $10.9 million indirect listing expenses paid in the quarter. Now, onto our outlook. As always, our guidance reflects the most recent customer conversations, spend environment, and event volume trends. Here's how we're thinking about some of the financial impact to the model. Heightened economic stress will cause more full and partial churn. We expect the impact on customer account to be larger than the impact on revenue as we see more churn with smaller customers. As a reminder, more than 70% of our revenue come from companies spending more than $100,000 a year. We are expecting lower event volume base expansion as customer growth slows. Our base case is that higher churn and lower event volume base expansion will persist through the first half of 2023. If the environment continues to deteriorate, the shape of the curve could be longer. Given the net retention rate is a trailing 12-month number, we expect it to decline. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting revenue between $62.5 million and $64.5 million, representing an annual growth rate of 28% at the midpoint; non-GAAP operating margins of negative 10% to 11%; non-GAAP net loss per share to be between $0.03 and $0.04, assuming shares outstanding of approximately 113.3 million. For the full year 2022, we are raising our revenue guidance between $235 million and $237 million with an annual growth rate of 40% to 42%. This is higher than our prior guidance, a range of $232 million to $236 million due to our Q3 wins. We expect non-GAAP operating margins to be between negative 11% to 12%, a marked improvement versus our prior guidance of negative 15% to 16%. And we expect non-GAAP net loss per share to be between $0.21 and $0.22, assuming shares outstanding of approximately 111.6 million. In summary, we delivered strong Q3 results amid the challenging environment. We remain incredibly well-positioned to win in digital analytics. We're in a position to invest as others are retreating. And as always, we're focused on long-term sustainable growth. With that, we look forward to your questions. Over to you, Yao. Yaoxian Chew As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up in the interest of time. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Turits of KeyBanc. Michael? Michael Vidovic -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi, this is Michael Vidovic on for Michael Turits. But thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter, guys. Spenser Skates -- Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Thanks, Michael. Michael Vidovic -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst On the CDP side, you talked about exceeding expectations internally. I know you're not giving specifics, but I'm curious if you could talk about what draws customers to your CDP versus the competitors. And then are those customers generally replacing an existing CDP provider, or they didn't have one to begin with usually? Spenser Skates -- Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder It's both. So, I think, first, in a macroenvironment like this, you're getting a bunch of spend consolidation where you're trying to eliminate multiple vendor spend and come on to us, something like an Amplitude. And so, being able to have a CDP and experiment offering, as well as a whole bunch of other stuff on products and marketing analytics helps us drive that. I think with H-E-B Grocery was actually example of they came on net new to Amplitude for the first time and they bought -- decided to buy the full stack outright. They didn't really have anything in place already. They had a bunch of people who just joined the company that had been previous Amplitude users and another company decided to go all in with us from the start. We are seeing other places where we're already on the analytics and then they're adding in CDP either because they don't have one or to replace an existing vendor. So, that's definitely happening, too. And so, I think from my standpoint, definitely a lot of strong data points in terms of traction from that, as well as experiment. Michael Vidovic -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Yaoxian Chew Great. Next question comes from Clarke Jeffries at Piper, followed by Elizabeth Porter. Clarke? Clarke Jeffries -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Hello. Thank you for taking the question. You know, first, I wanted to dig into the, you know, the highest quarter for new land bookings in the company's history. You know, could you dig into any industry or driver that really enabled that? And this is the first quarter of sub-100 net add in 2020. So, you're able to still net that strong quarter and new land even with a lower amount of customers. And so, you talked about how contract values were trending the new drivers of strength there. Spenser Skates -- Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Yeah. So, let me break that down for you. I think on one of the big trends that we're seeing is that I think historically it was only very sophisticated, more bleeding-edge technology companies that were big adopters of Amplitude. So, this would be, you know, the DoorDashes or the Atlassians or the Intuits or HubSpots of the world. That have already embraced this way of building product, and we're kind of ready to go when they first met us. I think what we're seeing is more of the kind of average or majority technology company. I called out Zillow, which was a fantastic land in Q3. We had a record -- another record deal that was actually an eight-figure deal for multiple years with a household tech company name. And so, that was exciting to see. So, I think you see this change from early adopter tech companies to more of the majority tech companies. And that's something that's happening in a big way now. I think, on the -- in terms of total number of customer adds, I think it's definitely a more challenging environment for some of the long-tail and smaller- and earlier-stage start-ups, where the funding is not like it was in 2021. And so, because of that, a lot of them are cutting back on resources and spend decisions and things like that. And so, that's how I net those two things out. Hoang Vuong -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Clarke. I just want to make a correction there. I think Spenser mentioned there was six-plus figure deal, it was not an eight-figure deal. So, I don't want to [Inaudible] we're overreacting to that. I do think the only thing I would add to that is what we're seeing in terms of acquisition of new customers, both last quarter and this quarter, you're starting to see some companies -- you naturally think of it being digitally native. So that's why we're saying we're so early in this market. Filing a company that you would think they've already been doing product analytics and digital analytics for a long time, going, \"Hey, wow, maybe this isn't the best way,\" whether it's their in-house solution or they were using some existing marketing solution, going, \"Hey, is there something better,\" as they evaluate and they discover Amplitude and they're moving over to us. And, obviously, those digital companies have a lot more event volume. They already have an existing digital business. And so, that's helping our land value. And as you pointed out, our new add did decrease relative to prior quarter, but a big chunk of that also had to do with churn from smaller businesses, as I mentioned, they're unable to pay. Clarke Jeffries -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Great. And then just one follow-up, Hoang. Another quarter of 48% CRPO growth, could you walk us through the divergence between revenue growth and CRPO growth? And ultimately, would you expect them to converge over the near term? Hoang Vuong -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, I would ask you to focus on the revenue growth. I mean, obviously, as I mentioned on the CRPO is benefiting from the multiyear and so as you kind of reach some kind of plateau in a multiyear area is that you may actually see a flip between revenue and CRPO. And so, I would focus on the revenue growth. Clarke Jeffries -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst All right, perfect. Thanks very much. Yaoxian Chew Great. Next question from Elizabeth Porter, followed by Arjun Bhatia. Elizabeth Porter -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thank you so much. I wanted to ask on the NRR. So, we could see that bigger decline and just because it is a 12-month rolling number. We don't usually see that much kind of quarter-to-quarter change. So, I was hoping to provide -- you called out a couple of headwinds, but just a little bit more color on where you're seeing kind of more of that pressure, the churn versus the upsell? And any sort of qualifiers on what we should think about for the floor? Is there a risk that that number goes kind of below what we saw in the first half of 2021? Thanks. Hoang Vuong -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Thanks. It's great question. I think Spenser mentioned this in his prepared comments in terms of the whiplash. I think what you're seeing is in 2021, we had some customers who really drove a massive expansion as their business grew and kind came back from COVID and post-COVID. I think what we're seeing actually in 2022 is the actually a combination of two things. One is expansion kind of being a lot less from those existing customer base and at the same time, you've also seen churn. We obviously mentioned in Q1, we had some high term both with Twitter and also us deciding not to do business with Russia and Ukraine. So, I think what you start seeing is you've got really high expansion that drove a lot of growth in 2021 and then you got lower expansion combined with higher churn as caused by the current macroeconomic and some of the things that happened in Q1, that's kind of play into that net retention rate. Spenser Skates -- Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Yeah. The only thing I'd want to add to that is, I think, from my standpoint, we want to do the right long-term thing for all our customers. And so, I think some of them may have overambitious projected out 2021 growth rates for the very long term. And so, a lot of them are asking us to rightsize spend. I don't think we're getting a lot of churns in that segment. And so what we want to do, all of them have confidence that they're going to increase their spend with Amplitude long term, and we're -- so we're deploying different levers to help them out, whether from helping them track the ROI that spend better by seeing what data is being used, who is using it to, selling -- getting them additional products if they're not getting all the usage that they want out of core analytics, or in some cases, decreasing the volume that they're doing with Amplitude. Hoang Vuong -- Chief Financial Officer I think Spenser makes a good point there. We did the same thing in early 2020 when first COVID first hit us. And you guys probably saw when we obviously went public, we published out a net retention rate of like 116, I believe, at that time. And I think the right thing is always to do the right thing for the customer because ultimately, you're going to expand into other business unit, other product lines, they're going to go and buy experiment an audience in CDP. And so, we love the future of where it is, and we're going to do the right thing for the customer in today's environment. Elizabeth Porter -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Gotcha. That makes a lot of sense. And for my second question, I just wanted to ask on the operating margins, really nice expansion that you got in the quarter. Is the pulling back on any of those expenses, is that more of a reaction to the macro or something more structurally and permanent? And also, just a little bit more color on what were some of the biggest areas of improvement that drove that leverage? Hoang Vuong -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I'll kind of talk through a few things actually because at the end of the day for us, we've always operated very efficiently. I mean if you look at our operating margin from last year and we're actually spending more -- we're actually increasing our investment in product development. We were at 19%, we're now at 23%. And so, we're actually investing in the increase in expenditures actually for this particular year centers around investment priority development. Some stuff, kind of, obviously call it post-COVID and returning to office, and also doing event like Amplify. And so, we're actually investing and spending. Some of the cutback that you're seeing is actually as a result of us kind of bringing in new leadership and them saying, \"Hey, let's take a pause on things we know are not working, so that I can actually redeploy and use them on new bets and new things that I think we're working even better.\" And we never want for spend, just to spend. That just seems silly. And so, I think our ability to turn our operating margins, and, obviously, our gross margin is at a very solid number of 74% compared to where we were before. Somebody wanted us gaining us three points. And then us also being much more prudent around our investment spend to make sure that we put more into things that are working and then taking off of things that are not. Elizabeth Porter -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Yaoxian Chew Great. Arjun from Blair, you're up, followed by Koji Ikeda from Bank of America. Arjun, please. Arjun Bhatia -- William Blair and Company Awesome. Thank you. Spenser, and maybe this one for Hoang, actually. Just want to clarify one thing. On churn, are you seeing churn in larger customers outside of Twitter? And is it true churn, or is it down-sell? And then just last one on this topic. As customers do churn, whether it's SMB or enterprise, what are they going to? Are they just saying, \"We don't need anything?\" Are they going back to their in-house system, going to GA? What's the replacement for Amplitude that they do decide to shut it down? Spenser Skates -- Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Yeah. Let me take this one high level and then I can let Hoang fill in on some of the details. So, the biggest reasons are either companies or business units getting shutdown or going out of business, or lack of ability to secure implementation resources. We almost never see someone kind of go backward in the maturity journey. It's not like folks are going to Google Analytics or just saying, \"Hey, I'm going to go try to build this in-house after having not been successful with Amplitude.\" And so that never happens. And so, I think for us, it's about making sure customers get implemented, customers get set up. That's a huge focus of Thomas and Lambert and team in terms of what we want to try to drive in this environment. The other thing is, from our customers, I think there is an expectation even for the ones rightsizing that they will continue to grow with us long term. I just talked to current six, seven-figure customer a few weeks ago that was like, \"Hey, I want to be conscious about how we're spending over the next year\" because they're going through spending reevaluation internally in their company. But their expectation is that in out years in 2024 and beyond that they'll continue to grow with us as they have since they've started with us five years ago. And so, for -- on the customer side -- it's not -- from a competitive standpoint, we feel really well set up. We're always kind of the product that's the most innovative bleeding edge in terms of what we're able to do. Hoang Vuong -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean the only thing I can add for you there, obviously, like you said you do see churn coming from small businesses that are unable to pay, I think the large enterprise customer, the only time they really do churn is that they really have not kind of adopted into our solution. Because if you're leaving -- to answer your question, there's no word -- they're not going to go back to something else. It's really either they're going out of business or they're just not going to get those questions answered. I do think that for the good customers, what we're seeing because of the macro environment is that they have a much tighter budget. And so, they may actually be looking at the data that they're sending in and trying to figure out ways to optimize that. Now we're actually taking a very different stance on it, which is we're saying, hey, great, we -- let's help you. I think Spenser mentioned this in the prepared remarks, we're trying to work around giving more visibility to the data owner to understand how they're using the data, what data has high value because again, we help them, we believe it would be better off in the long run. And so, it means that in the near term, they like, hey, I got budget constraint. I got to figure out how to save a dollar here, a dollar there. We're actually trying to help them identify which events may not be used and how you can actually do it smarter. And so, that's going to cause some near-term issues. But in the long term, I think the health of the relationship is going to be really strong. Arjun Bhatia -- William Blair and Company Yeah, absolutely. That makes a lot of sense. And then just when we -- when you think about the coming quarters and even going into next year, the Google Analytics opportunity, are you expecting that to ramp up, or is the -- is what you're seeing now in terms of the impact on new customers and the migrations that are taking place. Is that kind of a steady state that you expect to contribute over the next few quarters? Spenser Skates -- Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder I'd say -- I don't know, I mean, a third of our new customers coming from Google Analytics is already pretty significant. And so, I think we'll expect to continue to see that over the next few quarters. I mean, Google just announced that they're extending the sun-setting date for Universal Analytics because a lot of their customers are unhappy. And so, I think that will continue. Our focus there in terms of being the bridge from previous generation tool to Amplitude, we'll continue to bear fruit and be successful. That's a huge part of why we built out a whole bunch of marketing analytics that we talked about on last quarter's earnings call. And so, I expect to see lands. Now, will it grow even more? I certainly hope so, and we're investing in that way in the business in that way? Arjun Bhatia -- William Blair and Company Awesome. Thank you very much Spenser Skates -- Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Thanks, Arjun. Yaoxian Chew Great. Next question from Koji Ikeda, followed by Nick Altmann from Scotia. Koji, please. Koji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Great to see you, Spenser and Hoang. I wanted to ask you a question on billings. Spenser Skates -- Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Same to you, Koji. Koji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hey, guys. Wanted to ask you a question on billings. So, I recall back in the second quarter, there was kind of a $10 million pull forward and that would help back quarter but affect this third quarter. So -- but I guess even after adding back that $10 million, the third quarter billings would still be -- I mean, we calculate roughly 23%. So, a pretty big decel from what we've seen in the past. And then when you look at that compared to the billings growth 60%, and Hoang, I do realize that you just had focus on revenue, but billings has been really topical out there and with this big but delta. I just want to make sure we're understanding any sort of volatility or what could be causing volatility in the billings and how it could potentially affect the forward growth trajectory. Hoang Vuong -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks. First of all, as we said last time, our billings in Q2 actually grew 57% quarter to quarter. And so actually, that was a very strong billing quarter. And a big piece of that was obviously that you mentioned, the $10 million that we obviously moved to the renewal base, but we actually had a really large expansion happen in the month of April in Q2. And some of those customers are actually supposed to renew in Q3. And so yes, from a billing standpoint, we grew 4% year over year for Q3, referring to the fact that a big portion of that renewal base moved over Q2, we're actually -- that billion was actually a little bit higher than we were expecting. Koji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst OK. OK. So -- Hoang Vuong -- Chief Financial Officer And the last thing, I would -- one last piece just to remember on our billings, we tend to -- just as a reminder, we billed the following month, right? So, we don't bill in the same month. So, then we actually obviously have bookings that actually happened in the month of let's say, September, they're going to be billed in October, or if your contracts get started in October, you're not going to go down into October. And so that's another factor to catch into where the billing is going to come in. So, our billing will be pretty lumpy when you look at quarter over quarter and something like that. Koji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got it. OK. Understood. And then I wanted to ask you a question on international just really thinking about 40% of revenue for you guys is coming international, and Hoang, you mentioned you priced in USD. So presumably, it's a lot -- it's getting harder for international customers to buy the product. So just taking forward, if FX persists at these kind of levels, how are you thinking about packaging pricing internationally to help alleviate any sort of FX headwinds, international sales cycles? Hoang Vuong -- Chief Financial Officer This is actually -- it's not just international that we're looking at this. It's for the entire customer base. One of the big opportunities in 2023 for us is we're going to be focusing more on a product-led growth motion, which includes a self-service and a whole bunch of other things to allow customers to get started at lower price points or more easily with Amplitude as we get into next year. And so that's going to be -- that will allow someone to say, \"Hey, let's start small, prove out some ROI, and then grow with us over time\" is going to be one of the big levers as we look to next year. Koji Ikeda -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got it. Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Hoang Vuong -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, sure. Yaoxian Chew Nick Altmann from Scotia, followed by Claire Gerdes from UBS. Nick Altmann -- Scotiabank -- Analyst Yeah Great. Thanks, guys. I'm curious if you've seen sort of any change from customers, either on the net new side of the equation or at renewal, just in terms of their event volume commitments, right? Like just given the macro environment, I'm curious just from a customer perspective, are they taking a little bit more of a conservative approach to their event volume commitments and so perhaps, maybe there's going to be more overages in the future? Or have you guys not really seen more sort of scrutiny on upfront commitments at renewal or even on the net new side? Spenser Skates -- Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Yeah. So, it tends not to happen as much on the net new side. It really is on the renewal side that there are some customers that are putting a bunch of pressure on how much -- what event volume they're doing. That's why I mentioned that we're going to be doing a whole bunch more on the tooling side to give better transparency into the value, as well as helping them find other places that we can help drive that value. I think for event volume, one of the other big things is customers want to know that as they continue to scale with us, we'll scale with them. And so that's another big area of investment for 2023 is we're going to be doing a whole bunch there so for very, very large volume customers that we're able to track more of the data because the more data we can track the more value that we're able to provide. Nick Altmann -- Scotiabank -- Analyst Got it. Then can you just talk about how overdues have trended as of late and whether those have been sort of impacted given the macro? And as a follow-up, I guess, is it sort of pertain to your guidance philosophy? Do you typically embed a certain level of overdues in your guidance, or is that typically the driver of upside? Hoang Vuong -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Nick, I'll take that one. Overdues for us is a relatively very small percentage of our revenue, call it, under 2% or so. Because obviously, what typically happens is if customers are going over, they'll actually end up renewing and expanding under contract. And that's why we saw, for instance, in Q2 such a large expansion happened early in that quarter in the month of April, which is those customers were already over. And so, again, our No. 1 priority is partnering with the customer. And so, we're not trying to get them from overdues. We obviously -- it helps us to have the right contracts so that we can do a better job of planning and executing on that side. But we haven't seen kind of a, call it, again, it's such a small percentage. We've always seen a big increase or decrease per se on the overdues. It's been fairly consistent. If anything, it may have gone down slightly because some of those large customers already expanded, like I said, in April. So that after those expansions, always tend to go down slightly, and then they begin to build up again. But it's such a small percentage of it. Nick Altmann -- Scotiabank -- Analyst Got it. Yeah. Thank you. Yaoxian Chew Thank you. Next question from Claire Gerdes from UBS, followed by Tyler Radke from Citi. Claire, please. Claire Gerdes -- UBS -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking the question. So sorry to go back and harp on billings a little bit. But is the softness in the more a reflection of invoice timing or is it all related to the more flexible payment terms, maybe or changes in duration given the macro? And then, as a second part, as well, if billings on an adjusted basis for the pull forward, it's kind of in the low 20s. Should we think about it as a leading indicator going forward to potential revenue growth next year or maybe not? Hoang Vuong -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, a couple of things on billing. Again, the timing of the billing in terms for us does matter. And so, therefore, the timing of the bookings also matters. In Q2, our linearity of that booking happened to be more front-end loaded in the quarter. In our Q3, more of our bookings were more back-end loaded. And so now, being back-end loaded is actually more normal and typical for us. And so that's why we were talking -- even though we don't guide on billing, if we were -- as I mentioned earlier, I think our billion actually kind of was a little bit higher than we thought. But that has a lot to do with our linearity of where they happen. And so, as they happened in the end of the quarter, they'll get billed in the following quarter. Claire Gerdes -- UBS -- Analyst OK. Great. Thank you. And maybe you don't want to touch on the low 20s comment, but could that be used as kind of a leading indicator for rev growth, or since it's going to be so variable quarter to quarter, not something to focus on too much? Hoang Vuong -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean I would point you to what we guided for Q4 in terms of our guidance for that quarter. I think we're guiding to a midpoint like 28%. And as far as the fiscal year 2023, obviously, we'll wait until the early part of next year to provide guidance on that as we kind of continue to monitor the environment. Claire Gerdes -- UBS -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Yaoxian Chew Great. Next question from Tyler Radke. Tyler? Tyler Radke -- Citi -- Analyst Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch just on the go-to-market side. So, obviously, there's been some new changes to sales leadership. Just curious if how you're thinking about maybe some of the changes for next year as you're going through the planning cycle, whether it's from an overall messaging or just how you're thinking about organizing or compensating the salesforce? And then secondly, if you could just comment on your overall visibility into next year? I know RPO has been outgrowing current RPO. So, you are seeing multiyear contracts, but -- just give us a sense ofn how your visibility has improved and how we should think about next year. Thank you. Spenser Skates -- Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Yeah. So first, I'm really excited that Thomas is here. I mean, he's already driven a lot of changes within the organization, up-level leadership that we have across the board. So Tifenn, our new CMO, who I mentioned, very excited that he brought her in. Multiple hires across sales ops leadership, sales leadership, enablement, a few other areas. And we'll continue to evolve the team. I think the way I think about setting it up is we're building out the leadership from -- to take us from here to $1 billion in revenue, and that's a new kind of stage for us as a company. Obviously, we've done a great job in kind of getting us here, but now it's about how do we build the machine that executes for the next few years. In terms of the different areas -- I mean, from sales comp, we always love compensating great salespeople [Inaudible] So, if you want to make a lot of money, come join us here at Amplitude. And so that's an area that we're always evaluating how to reward great sellers and great sales performance and we want to make sure to set people up well there. I think there's a lot, just generally on the execution that we're focused on improving. So, I mentioned a whole bunch of areas during the prepared remarks, forecasting pipeline growth, enablement, inspection on top accounts, and things like that. And so, I think while we're -- I'm seeing a lot of great improvement there. Thomas has only been here for a few months, and so there's still quite a ways for that to play out as we go forward over the next few quarters. Hoang Vuong -- Chief Financial Officer And Tyler, to address your question on visibility. I think it's a little bit of a mixed bag. I think, obviously, we're really excited by the fact that we actually have more multiyear and you see it in our RPO. And then we're also starting to see some really great traction on the land side. But I think also the macroeconomic kind of pressure on both -- kind of both partial churn and full churn on those customer base, it's kind of -- this is a given in some of those clouds, too. And so, at the moment, it seems like we're always chasing one thing and then something else has changed. I think like if you were to ask me earlier in the quarter, we felt -- I'm sorry, earlier in the year, we felt really good about a lot of things. And then the question around land was actually going to be more like, \"Hey, how is that going to come out? How is that going to play out?\" And as we kind of put a lot of energy and execution on that, you're starting to see the benefit from that. And now, obviously, the macro is causing some of those things that we weren't really expecting. And so -- but we're going to work and manage through those, too. Tyler Radke -- Citi -- Analyst Great. And then if I could just ask a follow-up on competition. So obviously, you touched on Google Analytics earlier, but just as we think about the reduced VC funding environment and obviously less capital formation. How are you seeing that change the competitive position with some of the privates out there if there's anything to call out? Thank you. Spenser Skates -- Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Yeah. I mean we're still in a great competitive position. I think we continue to win a lot of the top-growing companies. I mean BeReal's a phenomenal example of that on the consumer side, where they've really taken off in a big way and their big Amplitude customers. And our focus is continuing on trying to win that. I think one of the big things, as I talked about, is like pricing and packaging to make sure that we have more options and opportunities for those people to come on to Amplitude. I think the value in them is not just in the revenue, but that a lot of those companies are the most bleeding edge when it comes to how they think about what data they're looking at and how they're using that to drive product. And so, we want to make sure to be successful with them, which is why we're doing a bunch on the pricing and packaging front as well into making sure to be very specific about targeting the top-grown companies. A lot of them -- a lot of the larger companies, both in tech and nontech actually look to those start-ups when they say, \"How should I build out the data-driven product first culture?\" And so, it's super important for us to win. And so, we're continuing to do that, and we're -- that's always a top priority on our end. Tyler Radke -- Citi -- Analyst Thank you. Yaoxian Chew Great. And with that, I'm seeing no further questions in the queue. We will be at the UBS Global TMT Conference in December. Details will be posted to the investor relations page of Amplitude's website at investors.amplitude.com. Thank you very much for attending our Q3 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. Spenser Skates -- Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Thank you, everyone. Hoang Vuong -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, guys.

        "Extracted Text": "Presentations made painless INSIDE THIS ARTICLE In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital analytics, Amplitude Inc. has emerged as a frontrunner, helping businesses harness the power of data to drive growth and optimize user experiences. Founded in 2012, Amplitude specializes in product analytics, providing organizations with the tools they need to understand user behavior and make informed decisions. As we move into 2024, understanding Amplitude\u2019s business model, conducting a SWOT analysis, and identifying key competitors becomes critical for stakeholders, investors, and businesses looking to leverage analytics for competitive advantage. This article will delve into Amplitude\u2019s business model, perform a SWOT analysis to evaluate its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, and explore its competitive landscape. Amplitude operates on a SaaS (Software as a Service) business model, providing organizations with cloud-based analytics solutions. Below are key components of Amplitude\u2019s business model: Amplitude primarily generates revenue through subscription plans tailored to the needs of different organizations. These plans vary based on the scale of data processing, the number of users, and the specific features required. This model allows Amplitude to maintain a predictable revenue stream while offering flexibility to its customers. To attract new users, Amplitude employs a freemium model, offering a free tier with limited features. This strategy enables businesses to test the platform before committing to a paid plan, thereby lowering the barriers to entry and encouraging user adoption. For larger organizations, Amplitude offers tailored enterprise solutions that include advanced features such as data governance, enhanced security, and dedicated customer support. This approach allows Amplitude to cater to the unique needs of large-scale clients while commanding higher price points. Amplitude has forged partnerships with various platforms, such as Segment, Zapier, and Salesforce, allowing seamless integration of its analytics capabilities into existing workflows. These integrations enhance the value proposition for users and expand Amplitude\u2019s reach in the market. Amplitude invests heavily in community building and educational resources, including webinars, tutorials, and a rich library of documentation. This focus not only helps users maximize the value they derive from the platform but also fosters customer loyalty and engagement. A SWOT analysis provides a comprehensive view of Amplitude\u2019s current standing in the market, taking into account both internal and external factors. Innovative Technology: Amplitude\u2019s advanced analytics capabilities allow businesses to track user behavior effectively and derive actionable insights. The platform offers features like cohort analysis, retention tracking, and user segmentation, setting it apart from competitors. User-Friendly Interface: The platform is designed with a focus on user experience, making it accessible for teams without extensive technical expertise. This ease of use aids in quicker adoption across organizations. Strong Brand Reputation: Over the years, Amplitude has built a strong brand reputation as a leader in product analytics. Many well-known companies, including IBM, Microsoft, and HubSpot, leverage Amplitude\u2019s services, which enhances its credibility in the market. Robust Community Support: Amplitude has developed a vibrant community of users and experts who contribute to forums, knowledge sharing, and best practices. This community aspect enhances customer engagement and retention. Dependency on Subscription Revenue: As a SaaS company, Amplitude\u2019s revenue is heavily reliant on subscription renewals. Economic downturns or budget cuts in client organizations could negatively impact revenue. Limited Market Penetration: While Amplitude is recognized in the analytics space, it is still competing against well-established players like Google Analytics and Mixpanel. This competition poses challenges in capturing market share in certain segments. Scalability Challenges: As organizations grow, their analytics needs evolve. Some users may find that Amplitude's advanced features come with a steep learning curve, potentially hindering scalability for smaller teams. Growth in Data Analytics Market: The global data analytics market is projected to grow significantly, presenting Amplitude with opportunities for expansion. By enhancing its offerings and targeting new segments, Amplitude can capture a larger share of this growing market. Expansion into Emerging Markets: There is a growing demand for analytics solutions in emerging markets. By tailoring solutions to meet the specific needs of these regions, Amplitude can establish a foothold in new geographical areas. Product Development: Continuous innovation and development of new features can attract new customers and retain existing ones. Investing in machine learning and AI capabilities could further enhance the platform\u2019s analytical power. Intense Competition: The analytics space is highly competitive, with numerous players offering similar functionalities. The entry of new competitors could erode Amplitude\u2019s market share, especially if they provide more cost-effective solutions. Data Privacy Regulations: Increasingly stringent data privacy regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA, pose challenges for analytics companies. Compliance with these regulations can incur additional costs and complexity for Amplitude. Economic Uncertainty: Macroeconomic factors, including inflation and recession, can impact businesses\u2019 budgets for analytics tools. If organizations prioritize cost-cutting measures, it could lead to reduced spending on tools like Amplitude. As we analyze Amplitude\u2019s competitive landscape, it\u2019s essential to identify key players in the analytics domain and how they stack up against Amplitude. One of the most widely used analytics platforms, Google Analytics offers a comprehensive suite of tools for tracking website and app performance. Its free version is particularly appealing to small businesses, while its premium offering, Google Analytics 360, caters to larger enterprises. However, Google Analytics primarily focuses on web traffic and may not provide the in-depth product analytics that Amplitude specializes in. Mixpanel is a direct competitor to Amplitude, providing similar product analytics solutions. Mixpanel emphasizes event-based tracking and is known for its user-friendly interface. While both platforms are strong contenders, Mixpanel is often viewed as more suitable for smaller companies, while Amplitude caters to a broader range of enterprise clients. Heap offers a unique approach by automatically capturing every user interaction, eliminating the need for manual tracking. This feature sets it apart in the analytics space. However, Heap\u2019s pricing model can be a barrier for some organizations, particularly smaller ones. A part of Adobe Experience Cloud, Adobe Analytics provides robust tools for enterprise-level analytics. While it offers extensive features and customization options, its complexity may pose challenges for smaller teams, making Amplitude a more accessible choice for those looking for user-friendly solutions. While Segment is primarily a customer data platform, it plays a crucial role in the analytics ecosystem by enabling businesses to collect and manage data from various sources. Segment integrates seamlessly with analytics tools, including Amplitude, allowing businesses to utilize both platforms effectively. As we head into 2024, several key trends will shape the landscape in which Amplitude operates: Increased Focus on Customer Experience: Organizations are prioritizing customer experience more than ever, driving demand for analytics tools that can provide deeper insights into user behavior. AI and Machine Learning Integration: The integration of AI and machine learning in analytics tools will enhance predictive capabilities, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions proactively. Emphasis on Data Privacy: With growing concerns around data privacy, companies will prioritize platforms that comply with regulations and provide robust data protection measures. Remote Work Adoption: The shift toward remote work has accelerated the demand for digital tools that enable collaboration and data sharing across distributed teams. As Amplitude Inc. navigates the competitive landscape of 2024, its ability to innovate and adapt will be crucial for sustaining its position as a leading product analytics provider. By understanding its business model, leveraging its strengths, addressing weaknesses, and capitalizing on emerging opportunities, Amplitude can continue to thrive in a rapidly changing industry.

        "Extracted Text": "This has led to a proliferation of digital analytics platforms for software companies to monitor their performance. These platforms have evolved to include a bevy of features to track and assess performance, including conversion rates, retention tracking, and overall customer experience journeys. Amplitude was an early entrant, but the company now faces competition from a number of other analytics vendors, each with its unique set of advantages and potential drawbacks. Let's dive into Amplitude, and then explore potential alternatives in detail. Amplitude is an analytics tool for growth and product teams, providing insights into user behavior and customer journeys to inform digital business strategies. Co-founders Spenser Skates and Curtis Liu launched the company in 2012 after discovering a gap in the market\u2014no existing tools, at the time, were available to help make sense of how users interacted with their app. After emerging from stealth mode in 2014, the San Francisco-based company matured into one of the largest players in the digital analytics space with more than 2,400 customers. Amplitude has been steadily broadening its suite of products in a bid to catch up with industry competitors. In 2021, the company announced Amplitude Experiment, a suite of tools that integrates A/B testing with its customer behavior and product analytics features. This was followed in 2023 when Amplitude announced its first warehouse-native solution. Pricing model: Amplitude offers its products in separate segments, including Analytics, Audiences, Experiments, and CDP, with incremental pricing for each. Features such as advanced permissions and real-time monitoring are exclusive to the top-tier package. Starter tier: A free Amplitude Analytics package with limited functions Growth tier: $995 per month Enterprise: Contact sales Notable features: Warehouse-native solution Customer journey mapping Campaign management Behavioral targeting Watch out for: Users have reported that Amplitude can sometimes be difficult to navigate and even \u201coverwhelming,\u201d especially for new users. This complexity can potentially confuse non-analysts due to its packed features. One user noted that it can be difficult to move data in and out of Amplitude, which can be a significant inconvenience for users who need to manage large datasets or require flexibility in data operations. Pricing model: Statsig offers unlimited seats, free feature flags, and . Starter tier: Up to 500 million free events, and a Pro tier: Starting at $150/month Enterprise and Warehouse-Native: Contact sales Notable features: Advanced stats engine (CUPED and sequential testing with Bayesian or Frequentist approaches) Highly rated in-house support team Out-of-the-box metric attributes Holdouts, Experiment Layers, Dynamic Configs, and more Warehouse-native or cloud-based implementation Advanced experimentation features like switchback testing, automatic rollout metrics, snapshot metrics view, and more Summary: Founded by ex-Meta engineer Vijaye Raji, Statsig provides a flexible platform that offers cloud-based and warehouse-native solutions for product experimentation, feature flagging, and analysis. The tool has received hundreds of positive reviews and has become popular among developers and product teams. Although it initially targeted smaller companies, it has now expanded to include major tech players such as Microsoft, Notion, and Figma, who are among its users. Watch out for: One user notes the learning curve associated with Statsig, stating: \u201c[Y]ou need to invest time to learn the system to unlock the most value from the platform.\u201d The user commends the support team and documentation for being helpful but expresses a wish for \u201cfuture iterations of the platform to include turn-key templates for more complicated setups such as multi-site/tenant.\u201d \u2705 Feature comparison: Statsig versus Amplitude, head-to-head. Pricing model: Adobe offers a scalable pricing model that adjusts to the size and scope of a business\u2019s analytics needs. Starter tier: Pricing starts around $2,500 per month for smaller companies, ballooning to upwards of $100,000 monthly for enterprise solutions. Notable features: Real-time reporting Clean and simple user dashboard UI Collaboration and sharing Tracking and KPI performance analysis Summary: Adobe Analytics, part of Adobe\u2019s Experience Cloud, was launched as Omniture in 1996 and later acquired by Adobe in 2009. It tracks web and app usage, offering features like advanced segmentation, real-time data, and predictive analytics. It helps businesses analyze customer behavior, optimize marketing campaigns, and enhance user experiences. Watch out for: Some users have raised concerns over Adobe\u2019s slow server speeds, resulting in users encountering performance and data reporting latency. While data is typically returned to users within 15-to-20 minutes, the servers can sometimes be \u201cslow to collect and show all the data for several hours.\u201d Another reviewer gripes about the difficult setup process: \u201cIn my experience, set up of a new website in Adobe Analytics from scratch is absolutely atrocious. It is not ready to roll out of the box, unlike other web analytics software.\u201d Starter tier: Mixpanel offers a free tier for up to 20 million events per month. Pricing model: The growth plan includes more advanced features like no-code data transformations and data pipeline add-ons, with a price of $25 a month. The enterprise version includes its full suite of services and premium support, with a price of $833 per month. Notable features: SQL queries and data pipelines Behavioral segmentation Customizable dashboards Automatic funnel segment analysis Summary: Mixpanel is a user analytics tool that tracks user interactions on websites and apps. Launched in 2009, the tool offers event tracking, funnel analysis, and retention tracking, helping businesses understand customer behavior and improve their products. Watch out for: Some commenters warn that customer support has waned over time, forcing some users to troubleshoot issues on their own. A customer points out that Mixpanel does not provide a phone number for support, instead requiring customers to reach out via email. Online commenters also say the platform is relatively expensive after reaching user limits. Starter tier: Google Analytics free version allows users to track up to 10 million hits a month. Pricing model: Google Analytics 360 caters to larger enterprises with high traffic, offering a subscription model that varies on each customer\u2019s specific needs. Notable features: Goal setting and tracking Advanced e-commerce analytics Personalized dashboards Machine learning for predictive analytics Summary: Google Analytics is a web and app analytics tool, part of the search engine\u2019s marketing suite. Launched in 2005, the tool tracks and analyzes web traffic and user events, helping product teams assess online campaigns, landing page quality, and conversions. Google Analytics evolved to include machine learning for predictive analytics and enhanced e-commerce tracking, among other new features. Watch out for: Online commenters warn that Google Analytics can often be time-consuming and otherwise difficult to use. As one user writes: \u201cGoogle Analytics is not user friendly. It\u2019s difficult to navigate and it\u2019s difficult to make sense of it. I have wasted a lot of time setting up an account and setting up my information, only to have one IT issue after another, rendering it almost useless.\u201d There may also be concerns over its compliance with General Data Protection Regulation, or so-called GDPR, regulations. A Swedish Watchdog group discovered that \u201csupplementary measures applied by Google to European users\u2019 data sent to the U.S. for processing were insufficient to raise the level of protection to the required legal standard.\u201d Additional reading: Use Statsig for analytics The debate between Bayesian and frequentist statistics sounds like a fundamental clash, but it's more about how we talk about uncertainty than the actual decisions we make.

Amplitude, Inc. stock traders use a variety of tools to make a prediction on which way the AMPL market is likely to head next. These tools can roughly be divided into indicators and chart patterns. When trying to make a Amplitude, Inc. stock forecast, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall. Moving averages are among the most popular Amplitude, Inc. stock prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for AMPL stock over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for AMPL is a sum of AMPL\u2019s closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12. In addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action. 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the stock market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the Amplitude, Inc. stock price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for Amplitude, Inc. stock. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually interpreted as a negative forecast for the AMPL market. Traders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the Amplitude, Inc. stock price. When making a Amplitude, Inc. stock forecast, most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of Amplitude, Inc. stock with different granularity \u2013 for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremely short-term price action or choose a weekly candlestick chart to identify long-terms trends. 1-hour, 4-hour and 1-day candlestick charts are among the most popular. Let\u2019s use a 1-hour candlestick chart as an example of how this type of price chart gives us information about opening and closing prices. The chart is divided into \u201ccandles\u201d that give us information about Amplitude, Inc.\u2019s stock price action in 1-hour chunks. Each candlestick will display AMPL\u2019s opening price, closing price, as well as the highest and lowest prices that Amplitude, Inc. reached within the 1-hour period. This information makes it easier to make an informed price prediction. It\u2019s also important to pay attention to the color of the candle \u2013 a green candle means that the closing price was higher than the opening price, while a red candle tells us the opposite. Some charts will use hollow and filled candlestick bodies instead of colors to represent the same thing. Just like with any other asset, the price action of Amplitude, Inc. stock is driven by supply and demand. These dynamics can be influenced by fundamental factors, such as earnings announcements, new product launches, acquisitions and mergers, and other factors. The AMPL stock price can also be influenced by market sentiment, broader economic conditions, interest rates, inflation rates and political developments. Some traders try to identify candlestick patterns when making stock price predictions to try and get an edge over the competition. Some candlestick formations are seen as likely to forecast bullish price action, while others are seen as bearish.

Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning the Company\u2019s possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events, or results of operations, are forward-looking statements. In some instances, these statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cseeks,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cscheduled,\u201d \u201canticipates\u201d or \u201cintends\u201d or the negatives of these terms or variations of them or similar terminology.

The Company undertakes no obligations to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and that may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors in evaluating the Company\u2019s financial performance. The Company uses these measures internally to establish forecasts, budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor its business, as well as evaluate its underlying historical performance and to measure incentive compensation, as we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures depict the true performance of the business by encompassing only relevant and controllable events, enabling the Company to evaluate and plan more effectively for the future. In addition, the Company\u2019s debt agreements contain covenants that use a variation of these measures for purposes of determining debt covenant compliance. The Company believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that its management uses in analyzing operating results. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and the items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company\u2019s financial performance. Accordingly, these key business metrics have limitations as an analytical tool. They should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of the Company\u2019s liquidity, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Please refer to the tables below for the reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of management. Although the Company believes that its plans, intentions, and expectations reflected in or suggested by these forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot assure you that it will achieve or realize these plans, intentions, or expectations. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning the Company\u2019s possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events, or results of operations, are forward-looking statements. In some instances, these statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cseeks,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cscheduled,\u201d \u201canticipates\u201d or \u201cintends\u201d or the negatives of these terms or variations of them or similar terminology. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. You should not put undue reliance on these statements which speak only as of the date hereof. You should understand that the following important factors, among others, could affect the Company\u2019s future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company\u2019s forward-looking statements: the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the Company or others; the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; the ability of the Company to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with customers, compete within its industry and retain its key employees; the possibility that the Company may be adversely impacted by other economic conditions (including the rapidly evolving conflict between Russian and the Ukraine), business, and/or competitive factors; future exchange and interest rates; and other risks and uncertainties included under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in other Company filings that have been made or will be made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no obligations to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and that may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors in evaluating the Company\u2019s financial performance. The Company uses these measures internally to establish forecasts, budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor its business, as well as evaluate its underlying historical performance and to measure incentive compensation, as we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures depict the true performance of the business by encompassing only relevant and controllable events, enabling the Company to evaluate and plan more effectively for the future. In addition, the Company\u2019s debt agreements contain covenants that use a variation of these measures for purposes of determining debt covenant compliance. The Company believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that its management uses in analyzing operating results. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and the items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company\u2019s financial performance. Accordingly, these key business metrics have limitations as an analytical tool. They should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of the Company\u2019s liquidity and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Jon Wilk, CompoSecure\u2019s President and CEO commented, \u201cWe had an outstanding quarter, and I am proud that we have achieved record results through strong sales execution, deep customer relationships, and international expansion. Looking ahead, we expect continued growth in our metal payment card business driven by both new customers and expansion of business from our existing base. In addition, we believe that we will benefit from ongoing card issuer trends such as the robust demand for travel and entertainment spending, and the high demand for premium metal card products.\u201d He continued, \u201cCurrent challenges in the digital asset market, including crypto exchanges freezing or limiting withdrawals, are driving an increased need for consumers to control their private keys, and we are encouraged by recent partnerships for security, authentication, and cold storage leveraging our Arculus platform. At the same time, this market cycle has created uncertainty in timing for our anticipated Arculus ramp up since some of our partners and targets have been impacted. As we have stated, we continue to be thoughtful about how we are running the business and remain focused on margins while simultaneously managing our investments to capture long-term value for our shareholders. We are confident that our Arculus platform is well positioned to meet the current and anticipated needs of the market.\u201d Mr. Wilk added, \u201cWe have delivered exceptional results through the first half of the year while navigating a dynamic environment.

CompoSecure, Inc. stock traders use a variety of tools to make a prediction on which way the CMPO market is likely to head next. These tools can roughly be divided into indicators and chart patterns. When trying to make a CompoSecure, Inc. stock forecast, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall. Moving averages are among the most popular CompoSecure, Inc. stock prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for CMPO stock over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for CMPO is a sum of CMPO\u2019s closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12. In addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action. 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the stock market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the CompoSecure, Inc. stock price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for CompoSecure, Inc. stock. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually interpreted as a negative forecast for the CMPO market. Traders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the CompoSecure, Inc. stock price. When making a CompoSecure, Inc. stock forecast, most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of CompoSecure, Inc. stock with different granularity \u2013 for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremely short-term price action or choose a weekly candlestick chart to identify long-terms trends. 1-hour, 4-hour and 1-day candlestick charts are among the most popular. Let\u2019s use a 1-hour candlestick chart as an example of how this type of price chart gives us information about opening and closing prices. The chart is divided into \u201ccandles\u201d that give us information about CompoSecure, Inc.\u2019s stock price action in 1-hour chunks. Each candlestick will display CMPO\u2019s opening price, closing price, as well as the highest and lowest prices that CompoSecure, Inc. reached within the 1-hour period. This information makes it easier to make an informed price prediction. It\u2019s also important to pay attention to the color of the candle \u2013 a green candle means that the closing price was higher than the opening price, while a red candle tells us the opposite. Some charts will use hollow and filled candlestick bodies instead of colors to represent the same thing. Just like with any other asset, the price action of CompoSecure, Inc. stock is driven by supply and demand. These dynamics can be influenced by fundamental factors, such as earnings announcements, new product launches, acquisitions and mergers, and other factors. The CMPO stock price can also be influenced by market sentiment, broader economic conditions, interest rates, inflation rates and political developments. Some traders try to identify candlestick patterns when making stock price predictions to try and get an edge over the competition. Some candlestick formations are seen as likely to forecast bullish price action, while others are seen as bearish.

        "Extracted Text": "LEHI, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Weave (NYSE: WEAV), a leading all-in-one customer experience and payments software platform for small and medium-sized healthcare businesses, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \u201cThis success reflects our commitment to putting our customers first and delivering innovative solutions that meet their needs.\u201d \u201cWe delivered another strong quarter, with solid top-line performance and substantial improvements in gross margins, operating margins, and free cash flow. Notably, we achieved another major performance milestone by reporting positive non-GAAP operating income for the first time in the company\u2019s history,\u201d said CEO Brett White. \u201cThis success reflects our commitment to putting our customers first and delivering innovative solutions that meet their needs.\u201d Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights Recent Business Highlights: Financial Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Outlook The company expects to achieve the following financial results for the three months and full year ending December 31, 2024: Fourth Quarter Full Year (in millions) Total revenue $52.6 - $53.6 $202.7 - $203.7 Non-GAAP income from operations $0.9 - $1.9 $0.0 - $1.0 Weighted average share count 72.7 71.6 The guidance provided above constitutes forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d safe harbor section below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP income from operations excludes estimates for, among other things, stock-based compensation expense. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial guidance measure to a corresponding GAAP financial guidance measure is not available on a forward-looking basis because we do not provide guidance on GAAP income (loss) from operations and are not able to present the various reconciling cash and non-cash items between GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP income from operations without unreasonable effort. In particular, stock-based compensation expense is impacted by our future hiring and retention needs, as well as the future fair market value of our common stock, all of which is difficult to predict and is subject to change. The actual amount of these expenses during 2024 will have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results. Webcast The company will host a conference call and webcast for analysts and investors on Wednesday, October 30, 2024, beginning at 4:30 p.m. EDT. Individuals interested in listening to the conference call may do so by dialing (862) 298-0702 or toll free at (888) 645-4404. Please reference the following conference ID: 13749491.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release and the accompanying conference call contain forward-looking statements including, among others, current estimates of fourth quarter and full year 2024 revenue and non-GAAP income from operations, and statements regarding our addressable market in the quotes of our Chief Executive Officer. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if any of our assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include risks associated with: our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and increase our customers\u2019 use of our platform; our ability to manage our growth; the impact of unfavorable economic conditions and macroeconomic uncertainties on our company; our ability to maintain and enhance our brand and increase market awareness of our company, platform and products; customer adoption of our platform and products and enhancements thereto; customer acquisition costs and sales and marketing strategies; our ability to achieve profitability in any future period; competition; our ability to enhance our platform and products; interruptions in service; and the risks described in the filings we make from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the risks described under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on August 7, 2024, which should be read in conjunction with our financial results and forward-looking statements and is available on the SEC Filings section of the Investor Relations page of our website at investors.getweave.com/. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements provided to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made. Channels for Disclosure of Information Weave Communications uses the investor relations page on our website, blog posts on our website, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts, our X (Twitter) feed (@getweave), our Facebook page, and our LinkedIn page as the means of complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. We encourage investors, the media, and others to follow the channels listed above, in addition to following Weave Communications\u2019 press releases, SEC filings, and public conference calls and webcasts, and to review the information disclosed through such channels. Supplemental Financial Information Dollar-Based Net Revenue Retention (NRR) For retention rate calculations, we use adjusted monthly revenue (AMR), which is calculated for each location as the sum of (i) the subscription component of revenue for each month and (ii) the average of the trailing-three-month recurring payments revenue. To calculate our NRR, we first identify the cohort of locations (the Base Locations) that were active in a particular month (the Base Month). We then divide AMR for the Base Locations in the same month of the subsequent year (the Comparison Month), by AMR in the Base Month to derive a monthly NRR. We derive our annual NRR as of any date by taking a weighted average of the monthly net retention rates over the trailing twelve months prior to such date. Dollar-Based Gross Revenue Retention (GRR) To calculate our GRR, we first identify the cohort of locations (the Base Locations) that were under subscription in a particular month (the Base Month). We then calculate the effect of reductions in revenue from customer location terminations by measuring the amount of AMR in the Base Month for Base Locations still under subscription twelve months subsequent to the Base Month (Remaining AMR). We then divide Remaining AMR for the Base Locations by AMR in the Base Month for the Base Locations to derive a monthly gross retention rate. We calculate GRR as of any date by taking a weighted average of the monthly gross retention rates over the trailing twelve months prior to such date. GRR reflects the effect of customer locations that terminate their subscriptions, but does not reflect changes in revenue due to revenue expansion, revenue contraction, or addition of new customer locations. Number of Locations We measure locations as the total number of customer locations under subscription active on the Weave platform as of the end of each month. A single organization or customer with multiple divisions, segments, offices or subsidiaries is counted as multiple locations if they have entered into subscriptions for each location. As a reminder, we only provide customer location information on an annual basis with annual and fourth quarter results and do not provide this information with financial statements or earnings releases covering interim periods. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this press release, Weave Communications has provided financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). We disclose the following historical non-GAAP financial measures in this press release: non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP income (loss) from operations margin, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to analyze our financial results and evaluate our ongoing operational performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in understanding and evaluating ongoing operating results and trends in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider these non-GAAP financial measures along with other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, operating income (loss), net income (loss), and our GAAP financial results. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation. Non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) margin and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as GAAP net loss adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, and non-GAAP net income (loss) margin as non-GAAP net income (loss) as a percentage of revenue. Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share is calculated as non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin We define non-GAAP gross profit as GAAP gross profit adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, and non-GAAP gross margin as non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses We define non-GAAP operating expenses, in the aggregate or its individual components (i.e., sales and marketing, research and development or general and administrative), as the applicable GAAP operating expenses adjusted to exclude the applicable stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations margin We define non-GAAP income (loss) from operations as GAAP loss from operations less stock-based compensation expense, and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations margin as non-GAAP income (loss) from operations as a percentage of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA We define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, interest income, other income/expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Our depreciation adjustment includes depreciation on operating fixed assets and we do not adjust for amortization of finance lease right-of-use assets on phone hardware provided to our customers. Our amortization adjustment includes the amortization of capitalized internal-use software and cloud computing costs. We further adjust EBITDA to exclude stock-based compensation expense, a non-cash item. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations. Additionally, management uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure our financial and operational performance and prepare our budgets. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software costs. We believe that free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides useful information to management and investors, even if negative, as it provides information about the amount of cash consumed by our combined operating and investing activities. For example, as free cash flow has in the past been negative, we have needed to access cash reserves or other sources of capital for these investments. The foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. For example, the non-GAAP financial information presented above may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. In addition, free cash flow does not reflect our future contractual commitments and the total increase or decrease of our cash balance for a given period. Further, Adjusted EBITDA excludes some costs, namely, non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the non-cash impact of stock-based compensation expense or working capital needs that will continue for the foreseeable future. All of these limitations could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools.

        "Extracted Text": "LEHI, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Weave (NYSE: WEAV), a leading all-in-one customer experience and payments software platform for small and medium-sized healthcare businesses, today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. \u201cOur strong financial performance highlights the continued demand for our software and payments platform and our ongoing commitment to enhancing business efficiency.\u201d \u201cWe had an outstanding quarter, continuing our track record of improving financial performance and setting the stage for a strong second half of the year. We delivered solid top-line performance, significant gross and operating margin improvements, and positive adjusted EBITDA for the first time in company history,\u201d said CEO Brett White. \u201cOur strong financial performance highlights the continued demand for our software and payments platform and our ongoing commitment to enhancing business efficiency.\u201d The year-over-year increases in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were consistent with the Company\u2019s previously-disclosed expectations as the Company collected in the second quarter the billings it previously disclosed were deferred in March 2024, resulting in positive free cash flow for the first six months of 2024. Second Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights Recent Business Highlights: Financial Third Quarter and Full Year 2024 Outlook The company expects to achieve the following financial results for the three months ending September 30, 2024, and full year ending December 31, 2024: Third Quarter Full Year (in millions) Total revenue $50.7 - $51.7 $201.0 - $203.0 Non-GAAP loss from operations $(1.2) - $(0.2) $(3.8) - $(1.8) Weighted average share count 72.1 71.7 The guidance provided above constitutes forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d safe harbor section below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP loss from operations excludes estimates for, among other things, stock-based compensation expense. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial guidance measure to a corresponding GAAP financial guidance measure is not available on a forward-looking basis because we do not provide guidance on GAAP net loss from operations and are not able to present the various reconciling cash and non-cash items between GAAP loss from operations and non-GAAP loss from operations without unreasonable effort. In particular, stock-based compensation expense is impacted by our future hiring and retention needs, as well as the future fair market value of our common stock, all of which is difficult to predict and is subject to change. The actual amount of these expenses during 2024 will have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results. Webcast The company will host a conference call and webcast for analysts and investors on Wednesday, July 31, 2024, beginning at 4:30 p.m. EST.

These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if any of our assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include risks associated with: our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and increase our customers\u2019 use of our platform; our ability to manage our growth; the impact of unfavorable economic conditions and macroeconomic uncertainties on our company; our ability to maintain and enhance our brand and increase market awareness of our company, platform and products; customer adoption of our platform and products; customer acquisition costs and sales and marketing strategies; our ability to achieve profitability in any future period; competition; our ability to enhance our platform and products; interruptions in service; and the risks described in the filings we make from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the risks described under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on May 9, 2024, which should be read in conjunction with our financial results and forward-looking statements and is available on the SEC Filings section of the Investor Relations page of our website at investors.getweave.com/. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements provided to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made. Channels for Disclosure of Information Weave Communications uses the investor relations page on our website, blog posts on our website, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts, our X (Twitter) feed (@getweave), our Facebook page, and our LinkedIn page as the means of complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. We encourage investors, the media, and others to follow the channels listed above, in addition to following Weave Communications\u2019 press releases, SEC filings, and public conference calls and webcasts, and to review the information disclosed through such channels. Supplemental Financial Information Dollar-Based Net Revenue Retention (NRR) For retention rate calculations, we use adjusted monthly revenue (AMR), which is calculated for each location as the sum of (i) the subscription component of revenue for each month and (ii) the average of the trailing-three-month recurring payments revenue. To calculate our NRR, we first identify the cohort of locations (the Base Locations) that were active in a particular month (the Base Month). We then divide AMR for the Base Locations in the same month of the subsequent year (the Comparison Month), by AMR in the Base Month to derive a monthly NRR. We derive our annual NRR as of any date by taking a weighted average of the monthly net retention rates over the trailing twelve months prior to such date. Dollar-Based Gross Revenue Retention (GRR) To calculate our GRR, we first identify the cohort of locations (the Base Locations) that were under subscription in a particular month (the Base Month). We then calculate the effect of reductions in revenue from customer location terminations by measuring the amount of AMR in the Base Month for Base Locations still under subscription twelve months subsequent to the Base Month (Remaining AMR). We then divide Remaining AMR for the Base Locations by AMR in the Base Month for the Base Locations to derive a monthly gross retention rate. We calculate GRR as of any date by taking a weighted average of the monthly gross retention rates over the trailing twelve months prior to such date. GRR reflects the effect of customer locations that terminate their subscriptions, but does not reflect changes in revenue due to revenue expansion, revenue contraction, or addition of new customer locations. Number of Locations We measure locations as the total number of customer locations under subscription active on the Weave platform as of the end of each month. A single organization or customer with multiple divisions, segments, offices or subsidiaries is counted as multiple locations if they have entered into subscriptions for each location. As a reminder, we only provide customer location information on an annual basis with annual and fourth quarter results and do not provide this information with financial statements or earnings releases covering interim periods. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this press release, Weave Communications has provided financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). We disclose the following historical non-GAAP financial measures in this press release: non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss margin, non-GAAP net loss per share, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP loss from operations margin, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to analyze our financial results and evaluate our ongoing operational performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in understanding and evaluating ongoing operating results and trends in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider these non-GAAP financial measures along with other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, operating income (loss), net income (loss), and our GAAP financial results. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation. Non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss margin and non-GAAP net loss per share We define non-GAAP net loss as GAAP net loss adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, and non-GAAP net loss margin as non-GAAP net loss as a percentage of revenue. Non-GAAP net loss per share is calculated as non-GAAP net loss divided by the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin We define non-GAAP gross profit as GAAP gross profit adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, and non-GAAP gross margin as non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses We define non-GAAP operating expenses, in the aggregate or its individual components (i.e., sales and marketing, research and development or general and administrative), as the applicable GAAP operating expenses adjusted to exclude the applicable stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP loss from operations and non-GAAP loss from operations margin We define non-GAAP loss from operations as GAAP loss from operations less stock-based compensation expense, and non-GAAP loss from operations margin as non-GAAP loss from operations as a percentage of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA We define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, interest income, other income/expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Our depreciation adjustment includes depreciation on operating fixed assets and we do not adjust for amortization of finance lease right-of-use assets on phone hardware provided to our customers. We further adjust EBITDA to exclude stock-based compensation expense, a non-cash item. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations. Additionally, management uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure our financial and operational performance and prepare our budgets. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software costs. We believe that free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides useful information to management and investors, even if negative, as it provides information about the amount of cash consumed by our combined operating and investing activities. For example, as free cash flow has in the past been negative, we have needed to access cash reserves or other sources of capital for these investments. The foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. For example, the non-GAAP financial information presented above may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. In addition, free cash flow does not reflect our future contractual commitments and the total increase or decrease of our cash balance for a given period. Further, Adjusted EBITDA excludes some costs, namely, non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the non-cash impact of stock-based compensation expense or working capital needs that will continue for the foreseeable future. All of these limitations could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools.

Palantir Technologies (PLTR 3.83%) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Feb 03, 2025, 5:00 p.m. ET Ana Soro -- Office of the Chief Financial Officer Good afternoon. I'm Ana Soro from Palantir's finance team, and I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market close and posted on our investor relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our first quarter and fiscal 2025 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance, and other statements regarding our plans, prospects, and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures, is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation, and other earnings materials are available on our investor relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today's call are Alex Karp, chief executive officer; Shyam Sankar, chief technology officer; Dave Glazer, chief financial officer; and Ryan Taylor, chief revenue officer and chief legal officer. I'll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call. Ryan Taylor -- Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer 2024 was nothing short of incredible for Palantir. Our momentum accelerated through year-end, closing out 2024 with exceptional Q4 results, including an extraordinary top-line beat and outperformance led by our U.S. business. Revenue grew 14% sequentially and 36% year over year in Q4 and 29% year over year for the full year. The AI revolution continues, transforming industries and redefining how organizations operate. AI is a pivotal component in driving innovation and efficiency, something companies need to embrace or fall behind. With the proliferation of AI models, the raw AI labor supply is exploding. While everyone else is focused on the model supply side, we're transforming AI into a measurable stream of high-value finished goods and services. The result? The rapid emergence of quantified exceptionalism for organizations able to unlock the potential of these commoditized models through AIP. A byproduct of our incredible progress, our Rule of 40 score increased to 81 in the fourth quarter. It's a substantial leap to deploy LLMs into production with real impact. Most organizations are currently stuck on the wrong side of the widening chasm, working on their two-, five-, and 10-year plans, which become obsolete days later, failing to ever take action; but not Palantir or our quickly growing customer base. We've taken our position through our decades-long investment in developing the ontology, which allows organizations to seamlessly weave LLMs into their enterprise, unlocking their highest-potential leverage. In this AI revolution, anyone looking for a solution that actually works is going to choose Palantir. Last quarter alone, we closed $1.8 billion of TCV across our business, which represents a 56% increase year over year. We closed a record-setting number of deals in Q4, including 32 deals worth $10 million or more. Our U.S. business is at the forefront of the AI revolution, growing 52% year over year in Q4. Last quarter, U.S. commercial revenue grew 64% year over year and 20% sequentially. AIP continues to fuel new customer acquisition as we have nearly five times the number of U.S. commercial customers as we did three years ago and significant expansion opportunities at existing customers. Organizations who have crossed the chasm with Palantir are driving real impact quickly. In this AI revolution, the biggest risk is not moving fast enough, and organizations are looking to us. With Palantir, as soon as work begins, we are delivering real quantified exceptionalism for our customers. In my conversations, they are excitedly asking how we can replicate this success across their organizations. One of America's largest pharmacies has been a customer since early 2024 and signed a $67 million TCV engagement with us right after the pilot for workflows, including automatically load balancing, prescription fulfillment, and orchestrating patient outreach. An American telecom company became a customer approximately two years ago and recently signed a $40 million TCV expansion deal to help manage and accelerate their decommissioning of old network technologies and equipment in order to achieve significant cost savings. Last earnings call, we mentioned the leading global insurance organization that deployed AIP to help automate underwriting workflows, reducing a two-week process to three hours. That organization signed a nearly $11 million ACV expansion deal in Q4. Panasonic Energy North America is seeing the effects of its AIP expansion as they've created a maintenance assistant to help 350 technicians in making 5.5 million batteries per day, resulting in reduced machine downtime, greater throughput, and rapid onboarding of new technicians. In Q4, we also announced the customers in the inaugural Warp Speed cohort, which are using Palantir's Warp Speed to gain an advantage in aspects of their manufacturing operating system, including automated visual quality inspections and dynamic production scheduling. Anduril CIO, Tom Bosco, noted, \"By using the software, we've seen up to 200x efficiency gain in our ability to anticipate and respond to supply shortages.\" Our U.S. government business, the foundation on which Palantir was built, is exceedingly strong, with revenue growing 45% year over year last quarter. We take pride in supporting the critical missions we're delivering against. Notable deals included the U.S. Army extending its long-standing partnership with Palantir to deliver the army advantage capability in support of the army data platform for up to four years. We also announced our recent contract expansion with U.S. Special Operations Command, marking the first deployment of Mission Manager to U.S. special operations forces units. Our international commercial business continues to see pockets of growth alongside the large renewals of some of our long-standing customers. For example, Rio Tinto extended their partnership with Palantir for an additional four years, noting AIP is making their unstructured data accessible, allowing them to quickly attack problems previously deemed too complex. Using our software, network rail specialists coordinate 53 driverless trains, each with 240 wagons, ultimately improving throughput and safety. Our international government business also achieved strong growth. Revenue increased 26% sequentially last quarter, driven in large part by the U.K., including our work with the NHS to roll out the federated data platform, as 87 acute NHS trusts and 28 integrated care boards have signed up to use it as of November 2024. We accelerated through the end of the year, and we remained full throttle. We're at the dawn of this AI revolution. And in this winner-take-all AI economy, Palantir leads the way. I'll now turn it over to Shyam. Shyam Sankar -- Chief Technology Officer Thanks, Ryan. For the last two years, we've been saying that even while the LLMs are improving, the models across both open and closed source are becoming more similar. And performance will converge, all while the cost per token for inference continues to drop substantially. And that's because the market's been focused on AI supply in the models. With the release of DeepSeek-R1 that has gone from a contrarian position to consensus. It's now blindingly obvious to everyone. Our foundational investments in ontology and infrastructure have positioned us to uniquely deliver on AI demand. From the beginning, AIP was built for this reality. Chat was always a dead end. Instead, we viewed LLMs as a new runtime for the AI labor. To capture the productive value of this AI labor, you need an intermediate representation of your enterprise that AI can actually interact with. How do you allocate inventory, onboard customers, process claims, call for prior authorization, and the like? That intermediary representation that makes all of that possible is ontology, and that's why it's been the secret to our meteoric rise. We are convinced the normative value for AI is enterprise autonomy, the self-driving company. Users go from performing the workflow to supervising an army of agents, teaching them how to handle edge cases and reducing dwell time. This is where we are maniacally focused with our customers. We have been working with a large multinational bank to automate core back office processes. What used to take five days now takes three minutes. Much more than the labor savings, this improvement eliminates historical constraints on the middle office and now enables the bank to create entirely new and differentiated financial products. We're working with the top engineering and construction firm to automate the identification of risks across tens of thousands of pages of technical documents, replacing months of arduous manual reviews with AI labor that can flag major risks to engineers in minutes. And we're working with a large power systems company to automate the understanding of technical diagrams to turn them into quotes and to orders. And finally, we're working with an automotive supplier to analyze CAD files for component designs to have AI labor, validate engineering standards and manufacturability checks. That is a 100-hour process for human engineers, now automated and serving up exceptions for human review. The before and after with AI is stark, and the speed of implementation is accelerating. You can divide companies up into two categories: the quick and the dead. Turning to Warp Speed, Palantir's modern American manufacturing operating system, it continues to move at warp 10. Our nation is in the beginning of a great reindustrialization as we compete with China to secure a free world and individual liberties. This is a competition we cannot afford to lose. We announced our first cohort of Warp Speed customers, including Anduril and L3Harris. The response has been exceptional, and the pipeline is swelling. Warp Speed integrates engineering tests, production quality, and operations so that manufacturers can build better and build faster. Our FedStart offering hit a major milestone with the approval of our FedRAMP high environment for FedStart customers. This is radical acceleration, both in reduction of time and costs of market access for software companies in the federal space. Finally, in U.S. government, our deep investments in CJADC2 continue to deliver results. Maven continues to see significant adoption in its pathfinding new AI capabilities throughout the kill chain. Substantial new investments integrating contested logistics into Maven's AI-enabled kill chain met their moment in exercises in Q4. Adoption continues within the military departments, specifically Army, Air Force, and Space Force, as well as at the combatant commands with expansions at at SPACECOM, SOUTHCOM, AFRICOM, and STRATCOM, while Hurricane Helene response galvanized the adoption of Maven on unclass beyond just the secret and top-secret networks. The adoption has continued to grow as Maven is used for securing our nation's border and securing our nation's airspace by enabling drone domain awareness. And Maven is reaching our allies and partners via U.S.-supplied capabilities called Maven [Inaudible] all spurred by real-world events and the need to collaborate in real time in crisis. We are really just getting started with Maven and have an ambitious roadmap and a set of customer opportunities in front of us to deliver the unfair advantage our warfighters deserve. I'll turn it over to Dave to talk us through the numbers. Dave Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Sean. We had an outstanding fourth quarter. Revenue growth accelerated to 36% year over year, exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by over 900 basis points and representing a 1,600 basis-point increase compared to the growth rate in Q4 of last year. America continues to rapidly embrace the AI revolution, and we saw this unrelenting demand drive impressive outperformance in our U.S. business, which grew 52% year over year and 12% sequentially. Our U.S. commercial business grew 64% year over year and 20% sequentially, and our U.S. government business grew 45% year over year and 7% sequentially. On the back of this continued strength, we are guiding to a full year 2025 revenue midpoint of 3.749 billion, representing a 31% year-over-year growth rate. We delivered these outstanding top-line results while expanding adjusted operating margin to 45%, the strongest adjusted operating margin in the company's history. Our revenue and profitability drove a 13% sequential increase to a Rule of 40 score from 68 in the third quarter to 81 in the fourth quarter. We also had an exceptional cash flow quarter with adjusted free cash flow of 517 million, representing a margin of 63%, and $1.25 billion in adjusted free cash flow for the full year, representing a margin of 44%. Turning to our global top-line results. Fourth quarter revenue grew 36% year over year and 14% sequentially to 828 million. Full year revenue grew 29% year over year to 2.87 billion. Full year U.S. revenue grew 38% year over year to 1.9 billion. Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, fourth quarter revenue grew 39% year over year and 14% sequentially, and full year revenue grew 32% year over year. Customer count grew 43% year over year and 13% sequentially to 711 customers. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. Fourth quarter trailing 12-month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 18% year over year to 65 million per customer. Now, moving to our commercial segment. Fourth quarter commercial revenue grew 31% year over year and 17% sequentially to 372 million. Full year commercial revenue grew 29% year over year to 1.3 billion. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, fourth quarter commercial revenue grew 37% year over year and 18% sequentially, and full year commercial revenue grew 36% year over year. We had the strongest quarter of commercial TCV booked at 995 million, representing 42% growth year over year and 63% growth sequentially. Our U.S. commercial business is seeing unprecedented demand with IP driving both new customer conversions and existing customer expansions in the U.S. Fourth quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 64% year over year and 20% sequentially to 214 million. Full year U.S. commercial revenue grew 54% year over year to 702 million. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, fourth quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 76% year over year and 19% sequentially, and full year U.S. commercial revenue grew 69% year over year. We also had our strongest quarter of U.S. commercial TCV booked at 803 million, representing growth of 134% year over year and 170% sequentially. This exceeded our next highest quarter of U.S. commercial TV booked by nearly 400 million, highlighting the increased demand for AI production use cases. Total remaining deal value in our U.S. commercial business grew 99% year over year and 47% sequentially. Our U.S. commercial customer count grew to 382 customers, reflecting growth of 73% year over year and 19% sequentially. Fourth quarter international commercial revenue grew 3% year over year and 15% sequentially to 158 million, partially driven by revenue catch-up from a customer in Asia. Full year international commercial revenue grew 9% year over year to 594 million. For international commercial business, we continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East, and beyond, but remain focused on accelerating our growth in the U.S. commercial business. Revenue from strategic commercial contracts was 9.6 million for the quarter. We anticipate first quarter 2025 revenue from these contracts to decline to between 4 million to 6 million compared to 24 million in the first quarter of 2024. We anticipate 2025 revenue from these contracts to be approximately half of 1% of full year revenue. Shifting to our government segment. Fourth quarter government revenue grew 40% year over year and 11% sequentially to 455 million. Full year government revenue grew 28% year over year to 1.57 billion. Fourth quarter U.S. government revenue grew 45% year over year and 7% sequentially to 343 million. Full year U.S. government revenue grew 30% year over year to 1.2 billion. This acceleration was driven by continued execution in existing programs and new awards reflecting the growing demand for AI in our government software offerings. Fourth quarter international government revenue grew 28% year over year and 26% sequentially to 112 million, bolstered by our continued work in U.K. healthcare and defense. Full year international government revenue grew 23% year over year to 372 million. Fourth quarter TCV booked was 1.79 billion, up 56% year over year and 63% sequentially. Net dollar retention was 120%, an increase of 200 basis points from last quarter. The increase was driven both by expansions at existing customers and new customers acquired in Q4 of last year as we see the effect of the AI revolution. As net dollar retention does not include revenue from new customers that were acquired in the past 12 months, it does not yet fully capture the acceleration and velocity in our U.S. business over the past year. We ended the fourth quarter with 5.43 billion in total remaining deal value, an increase of 40% year over year and 20% sequentially, and $1.73 billion in remaining performance obligations, an increase of 39% year over year and 10% sequentially. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business. Turning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense. was 83% for the quarter and the full year. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, was 373 million, representing adjusted operating margin of 45%. Full year adjusted income from operations was 1.13 billion, representing a margin of 39%. Q4 adjusted expense was 455 million, up 1% sequentially and 14% year over year. And full year adjusted expense was 1.74 billion, up 9% year over year, primarily driven by our continued investment in AIP and technical talent. We expect to see a more significant increase in expense in 2025 as we invest in technical hires, the product pipeline, and continue our focus on AI production use cases, all while delivering our goals of sustained GAAP profitability. On the back of the strength of our results, we want to congratulate our employees for the successful delivery of their market-vesting stock appreciation rights or SARS. As a result of this achievement, we accelerated 131 million of one-time expense in the fourth quarter related to these equity awards. Fourth quarter stock-based compensation expense was 282 million, and employer-related equity tax expense was 80 million. Full year stock-based compensation expense was 692 million, and employer-related equity tax expense was 126 million. Fourth quarter GAAP operating income was 11 million, representing a margin of 1%. Fourth quarter operating income, when excluding one-time SAR0related expenses, was 142 million, representing a 17% margin. Full year GAAP operating income was 310 million, representing an 11% margin. Full year operating income, when excluding one-time SAR-related expenses, was 442 million, representing a 15% margin. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was 79 million, representing a 10% margin. Fourth quarter net income, when excluding one-time SAR-related expenses, was 165 million, representing a 20% margin. Full year GAAP net income was 462 million, representing a 16% margin. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share was $0.03. And earnings per share, when excluding one-time SAR-related expenses, was $0.07. Full year GAAP earnings per share was $0.19. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.14. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $0.41. Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 81% in the fourth quarter, a 13-point increase to our Rule of 40 score from the prior quarter. Turning to our cash flow. In the fourth quarter we generated 460 million in cash from operations and 517 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing margins of 56% and 63%, respectively. For the full year, we generated 1.15 billion in cash from operations and 1.25 billion in adjusted free cash flow, representing margins of 40% and 44%, respectively. Through the end of the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares as part of our share repurchase program. As of the end of the quarter, we have 936 million remaining of the original authorization. We ended the quarter with 5.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury securities. Now, turning to our outlook. For Q1 2025, we expect revenue of between 858 million and 862 million, and adjusted income from operations of between 354 million and 358 million. For full year 2025, we expect revenue of between 3.741 billion and 3.757 billion; U.S. commercial revenue in excess of 1.079 billion, representing a growth rate of at least 54%; adjusted income from operations of between 1.551 and 1.567 billion; adjusted free cash flow of between 1.5 billion and 1.7 billion; and GAAP operating income and net income in each quarter of this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks, and then Ana will kick off the Q&A. Alex Karp -- Chief Executive Officer Welcome to our Palantir revolution, otherwise known as our earnings call. There really is a lot of debate about with these numbers if we even should have an earnings call. But there was also a lot of debate around which number is the best internally. We were undecided whether our 29% growth in aggregate, our 38% growth in the U.S., or 54% growth in U.S. commercial, our Rule of 81 -- they may have to redo the rule because, you know, when you're doing twice the rule, of course, maybe the rule isn't fair to other companies. We may have to have a different rule, the Rule of 70 or something. But we blew through that over twice the Rule of 40. To say we did it our way is a minimization of what that meant. We have taken a long bet over decades around the assumption that if we built the products that -- our partners, most importantly, our partners in the West; most importantly, our partners in the U.S., ought to build -- not what they wanted us to build; not what they mandated we should build, not what investors; venture capitalists, or analysts were saying they would reward us for building that, that company would generate so much value, that we would get a small percentage of that, and we would end up as a massive, significant, and much more importantly, impactful company that could power the West to its obvious innate superiority, expose things that weren't working, rebuild the whole infrastructure of a company. We did that over with many platforms. Most successfully, however, it was our interest in figuring out how to power human-driven analytics with the assumption that what ought to come would not be human-driven, i.e., would be AI, at some point and that I potentially could be something like a large language model. And what we've delivered to the market is a symbiotic relationship between data, computer, LLMs, organized, powered, made possible, made valuable by something we dare to call an ontology, which was, in the beginning, viewed as a highly obnoxious anti-climatic term that people thought we were using to obfuscate bad financials. And that ontology and our willingness to stick to our guns -- again, because there's been billions and billions and billions of dollars invested in large language models, the idea that you could dare to build a product that was built on the assumption that the power of large language models would be in their ability to operationalize them in the context of the enterprise in common language. So, in -- that was a revolution that we saw, that we built against, that we've led, that we've gotten off the ground for us in America. We have 54% growth in the U.S. comm. We -- by the way, USG is now reaccelerated, grew 30%. We are guiding above 30% and 31%, and we're doing this in a very, very complicated environment. You know, the part of the reason we've done so well is the experts look to the past as an indication of the future when we're looking to the future as an indication of the present. And it's very, very hard to figure out what's going to happen. We see -- as much as I personally care about the broader West, including continental Europe, despite our best efforts and working out every day, it's anemic. We're growing around 4% on 13% of our company. It does look like the continent of Europe will look to the past as a way of getting to the future, struggles with the idea that all the valuable technology in this area is built in America; perhaps, struggles with the fact that to make LLMs work, you have to find a way to build something like an ontology. There's one available at Palantir. We have rejected -- we have rejected all the way through anti-meritocratic concepts, anti-transparent concepts. We're at the forefront of civil liberties. One of the reasons ontology is so valuable is because the concepts that we built into PG, that we built into foundry that are expressed in branching are concepts that both accelerate revenue. It get and decelerate, control capex, i.e., make the margins something like what you would find at Palantir, but do it in a way that actually makes the enterprise better, healthier, more ethical. We, at the end of the day, at Palantir are exporting our culture and way of doing things to enterprises, especially in America, by allowing enterprises to capture their tribal knowledge in a way that they can utilize LLMs, i.e., take the commodity side of LLMs and hyper charge or specialize their secrets of their enterprise using the secrets of our enterprise, namely, how do you build product, how do you end up with ontology, how do you implement it. And last not least, we believe we are making America more lethal, making our adversaries increasingly afraid of acting against the interests of America and especially Americans. And we are proud of our moral stance, and we are very long on the -- the U.S. and what is happening and what will happen in the future. And with that, we should open up our earnings call. This is obviously a very, very special time to be at Palantir. Palantirians are very excited. And I am -- yeah, it's by far the best time to be at Palantir. One of the things that's crazy important about our time at Palantir now is it's actually the vibe internally, the vibe with our clients, the vibe with inside of our products is. We are at the beginning of our trajectory. We are at the way beginning of a revolution. And we plan to be a cornerstone, if not the cornerstone company, in driving this revolution in the U.S. over the next three to five years. Ana Soro -- Office of the Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Alex. We'll now turn to a few questions from our shareholders before opening up the call. Our first question is from Christina, who asks, \"What is so unique about the ontology? How does it give you an edge over your competitors? And why wouldn't any of them be able to recreate something similar?\" Shyam Sankar -- Chief Technology Officer Well, thank you, Christina, for the question. I think we could start by thinking about, if I was building software to solve problems for one company. Well, you don't need an ontology. You just take the shortest path between A and B, and that doesn't involve ontology. You could think about, OK, what if I'm building enterprise software for many customers, in a traditional way, not a forward-deployed engineering where I have -- I'm thinking about it deductively, I have large multiyear implementations, never mind that those things never work. But the traditional software, industrial complex. You're not even going to conceive of ontology. But if you have the ambition to build software that works across government, across 50 different industries, you have to build ontology. It is absolutely the longest path between point A and point B, but it gives you superpowers when you show up to your customers. And it gives your customer superpowers when they're managing the change in their enterprise, mergers and acquisitions, fighting the entropy of the universe, competing in the market? But what makes ontology essential is AI. Ontology ends up being the intermediary representation that makes your enterprise accessible to AI in a way that's governed and secure and provides you the observability that you need so that you can actually trust the AI. But more importantly, the observability your regulators need so they can trust in your transition to being a self-driving company. Alex Karp -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, and it also allows you to manage them so that the actual taxonomy and ability to put the large language model where it can be can be more exact. So, it can be managed at scale. You can think of it as what we do on the foundry back end where we have to create pipelines, it's basically anti-segmenting the data. To get the AI to actually work in an enterprise, you have to re segment, reconcatenate that large language models in a way where the use case is thin enough that they can actually provide exact enough information. And the concatenation of that is exact enough to provide real results in an enterprise context, meaning you can rely on the large language model to do the same thing 500 people would be doing who are experts in dealing with text. And you can do that with three people. And then, the question that Shyam is getting -- is answering is also, but why is it hard to build it? So, now we know that Palantir is succeeding and has this pick your stat Rule of 81 growth with no basically a nascent sales force. It's actually very hard to build because in order to have an idea how to do this, you would have to have taken all the lessons of every single product we built, including security models, including how do you interact with the data of an actual enterprise, how do you impose branching. And then, you'd have to interact with that and build something to work with the large language models, not as they -- not as you thought they were, not as you'd like them to be, but as they are. And that process probably will begin for lots of companies now. It is a very long and hard process to do this in a productized form. And one of the reasons people didn't figure this out is because tech companies don't actually need this because they have one company and/or they have something, but it is not a product. Taking this from one company to a company that installs anywhere requires a very specialized, dedicated product building culture with deep understandings of -- understanding the enterprise. Last, not least, to -- in order to be able to teach the large language model to get more exact precise information, you would have to have a secure and cleaned access to the underlying data of the enterprise. No other company in the world has that kind of access like Palantir, and that's why we're completely uniquely positioned to do this. And luckily for the world, we're a very long America, and we're doing it primarily here because it's powerful as fuck. Ana Soro -- Office of the Chief Financial Officer Thank you both. Our next question is from Kamal who asks, \"How will the new Chinese AI model, DeepSeek, impact Palantir? And how can Palantir mitigate its impact? Shyam Sankar -- Chief Technology Officer Well, I think one of the obvious lessons of DeepSeek-R1 is something that we've been saying for the last two years, which is that the models are commoditizing. Yes, they're getting better across both closed and open, but they're also getting more similar. And the price of inference is dropping like a rock. But I think the real lesson, the more profound one, is that we are at war with China. We are in an AI arms race. And I got into a disagreement with Sam Altman about this at the Senate AI Summit over a year ago, where I was arguing that we are in an AI arms race. And there's an opposing view that we can all get along, and we can cooperate on these things. And I'm sure the other side feels quite different realizing that their IP has been stolen in this process here. But this war started long ago, it is an economic war with the ascension of China to the World Trade Organization, the greatest IP theft in history, the greatest wealth transfer in history. It is an opium war. The No. 1 cause of deaths of 18- to 45-year-olds in this country is fentanyl. That is coming from China. It is a diplomatic war. The Belt and Road initiative is basically indentured servitude for other countries to the CCP here. And the unprecedented phase zero gray zone operations of the CCP, how many times are we going to believe that anchors are dragged across the sea that cut undersea cables here? But I think one of the things -- you know, China knows they're at war. The question is we kind of equivocate on it as a peace-loving nation. But one of the things I want to make sure we all do realize is that the engineering in R1 is exquisite. The optimizations that they've done are really impressive. And I don't think you can get away with the facile explanation that the Chinese just copy and we're the only innovators. We have to wake up with the respect for our adversary and realize that we are competing. But they absolutely did steal a lot of that through distillation of the models and, perhaps, they stole even more. And then you can look at the GPU sales growth in Singapore. It's a tiny island nation. I'm pretty sure there's some sanction invasion going on there. And we have to realize that the AI race is winner-take-all, and it's going to be a whole of nation effort that extends well beyond the DOD in order for us as a nation to win. And that M day was yesterday. The time to mobilize has come. Ana Soro -- Office of the Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Shyam. Our next question is from Dan with Wedbush. Dan, please turn on your camera, and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Daniel Ives -- Analyst Thank you. So [Inaudible] talk about, are you surprised at all? Shyam Sankar -- Chief Technology Officer Can you repeat the question? We didn't hear you. Thank you. Daniel Ives -- Analyst Yes. Are you surprised at how quick these sales cycles are actually taking place from when a customer first meets Palantir, to now deploying AI initiatives? I mean, does that surprise the team at all? Ryan Taylor -- Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer I would say I'm not surprised because of the energy we feel on the ground in talking to customers and the impact. You know, Shyam, shared some examples taking a back office process from the largest banks from five days to under three minutes, taking what used to automating a process for an automotive supplier from what used to take 100 hours to be automated with just a human check. And seeing the reactions of those customers when those are implemented and seeing the impact and seeing them wanting to move quickly, seeing them wanting to start quickly, expand quickly, and essentially stay ahead of their competitors, like, feeling that energy and feeling that reaction on the ground, I'm not surprised because you feel it. It's tangible. Alex Karp -- Chief Executive Officer What surprises me a lot is just, you know, customers and especially countries are just reacting completely differently. So, in broad swaths, American companies have approached this revolution in a very pragmatic way, which is, you know, so we had all these experts saying that what you ought to do is buy a large language model and install it on your enterprise. And customers are like, \"Great, we'll try that, but we're also going to try Palantir.\" And there's really no ideology in this -- in aggregate in this country defining how people do things. It's about output, how quick is that output, what is -- and there are just -- there's a lot of communication between enterprises in America, especially in sectors, so people talk about what's working and what's not working. And in contradistinction, if you look at Europe with 13% of our business and 4% growth rate last year -- so, compare that, it's like more than 10x better in America in U.S. comm., right? And what's really happening there is people are reading literally basically PowerPoints of how you did tech installations in the 50s, and that's what they're doing. And what is jarring to me is that, you know, you just see adoption, radical adoption, from some clients. Again, you do have some people in America who are still doing science projects, but it's -- how could it be that one set of companies in one geography adopts. And in a very culturally similar geography, people are just like, \"OK, great, but that's not how we do it.\" And so, it's -- and this, by the way, is not just -- you know, we talk a lot about U.S. commercial because we can't really talk in detail what's happening on the battlefield. But the battlefield -- you know, Shyam could talk about this basically forever, that this is basically we enjoy. It's equally divergent. It's like you have cultures that are like we have to fight in a way that suits our culture, that suits our ethics, where we have a primacy of winning and a primacy of maintaining our values. And those cultures are rebuilding how they fight, rebuilding the things that they think are valuable, looking at the evidence of what worked, what didn't, what was the cost structure. And meanwhile, there's just a lot of people who are just like, \"Yeah, but that could get away in the way of vacation.\" And so, it is really, really jarring. I think one of the things I am sympathetic with when investors look at Palantir is like, yeah, but it's very hard to know because people are going on different paths. But, yeah, in America, in aggregate, the response is, \"I expected this to work in X amount of time, you got it to work and beat what I was expecting in 1/10, 1/20, 1/50 of the time.\" And by the way, the other thing that is super surprising is, you know, two, three years ago, when we were doing foundry or even some of our kind of more sensitive things in the military, I believe we were delivering results that were, you know, six months would have taken 10 years, and they were things that people couldn't do. But now, because of the time and the power, you can't really hide it as easily in some department of your enterprise. So, what would happen to us in the past is we would do a -- we do an enterprise thing. And because, obviously, people didn't appreciate our -- my charm, and there were no steak dinners and we weren't laughing at your jokes and we were probably saying the wrong things at the wrong times, the thing got stuck in some part of the enterprise. Everyone knew is the most important thing about the enterprise, but no one would acknowledge it. And now, it's just too powerful. People are like, \"Yeah, yeah, I don't particularly like them. They don't have the dinners. They don't wear suits. Shyam's hard to understand for me.\" But the results are massive, and that's what's driving the results in the -- that's what's driving the 54 number that we're guiding -- that we did last year, and we're guiding to this year in U.S. commercial. That's what's driving the beat. That's what's driving our ability to really maintain our culture. By the way, it's also the Rule of 81 really comes from this reaction to our company, but also because we can stick to our culture, our ontology of Palantir. We do not need 500 extra people a quarter. We just -- we can really power these things because the pull when people actually see it is enough to break down the institutional barriers, the political bullshit that often we were not able to break through in the past. Ana Soro -- Office of the Chief Financial Officer Thank you. Our next question is from Mariana with Bank of America. Mariana, please turn on your camera, and then you'll receive a prompt to unmute your line. Mariana Perez Mora -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Good afternoon, everyone. So, my first question is about disruption. Palantir has been, like, actually thriving when there is disruption from the very beginnings of the company, 9/11, coronavirus, supply chains, LLMs. Now, everyone is really concerned about DOGE with the change of administration. I could imagine, like, focus on efficiencies, focus on software modernization. Digitalization could actually be a really good opportunity for you. I don't know if you can deep dive on like how is Palantir positioned to that? And my second, question probably to Dave, but, like, I don't know, Shyam as well. When you see this demand, where do you invest to make sure that you are prepared to actually execute on it? Like, is it talent, is it sales, is it engineers, is it partnerships? Like, what do you do to make sure that you can actually capture this opportunity? Shyam Sankar -- Chief Technology Officer Thank you. Well, on the first question here, I mean, I think no one really knows, but -- and we sense a huge amount of fear among the traditional system integrators and providers here, the traditional providers of the monopsony, but we're pretty optimistic. And I think if you look at my comments over the past, even my recent Senate Armed Services testimony last week, Palantir's real competition is a lack of accountability in government. These forever software projects that cost an insane amount that don't actually deliver results, they're sacred cows of the deep state. You know, you can think about D6A, it cost billions of dollars and it didn't work. Soldiers and -- Alex Karp -- Chief Executive Officer Twenty-six billion. Yeah. Shyam Sankar -- Chief Technology Officer Soldiers in war zones preferred Palantir because it worked, and it happened to only cost millions of dollars. And I think DOGE is going to bring meritocracy and transparency to government, and that's exactly what our commercial business is. The commercial market is meritocratic and transparent, and you see the results that we have in that sort of environment. And that's the basis of our optimism around this. I think the work that we've done in government, it's deeply operational, it's deeply valuable, and we're pretty excited about exceptional engineers getting in there under the hood and being able to see that for a change. Alex Karp -- Chief Executive Officer We love disruption, and whatever is good for America will be good for Americans and very good for Palantir. And I think you got it exactly right. Disruption, at the end of the day, exposes things that aren't working. There'll be ups and down. There's a revolution. Some people get their heads cut off. Like -- you know, it's like, we're expecting to see really unexpected things and to win basically. That's what we're going to do. See unexpected things, report expected things, and win. And we're planning to do that, and we're pretty optimistic about the U.S. environment. Dave Glazer -- Chief Financial Officer And on the investing front, it's like it is quality engineering, right? It's quality engineers and you can see it sort of how we set up our comp programs, sort of -- and obviously, that does mean headcount is going to grow somewhat, but really, it is a quality engineers more than the quantity. And you'll continue to see us do that this year. We did it last year, particularly in the back half, and you're seeing it sort of in the numbers in Q1 and beyond. Alex Karp -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, you also, by the way, for the first time, people want to partner with us. There used to be partnership meetings were complete waste of time in BS, like largely so people could fill out a report that they met with us kind of thing, you know, like high-school dating for nerds. I met with them, perfect, I'm not going out with them. That was our experience with partnerships. Now, like in the last -- even the last couple of weeks, I've had real partnership discussions because a lot of these people who own verticals have to deliver. They're under a lot of pressure, and people know how good our products are. And last, not least, what we're really investing in my view is -- we're -- we have a truly unique culture. I visit with companies every week. I've been doing it for 20 years. I've never seen a company or a culture anything like ours. And that's what we have to fight to keep. And every single Palantirian is special. Everyone here is doing something unique. We need to continue to attract and retain people who are different, think differently, are different, and get them focused on the world's most important missions, building products the way we know how to build them. And that's our primary investment. It's not actually a question of money, which, you know, means that that's how we crush the margins. It's about talent and, you know, just building really great things, the things you ought to build, not the things you're supposed to build, and getting them to the front line. Ana Soro -- Office of the Chief Financial Officer Thank you, all. Alex, as always, we have a lot of individual investors on the line. Is there anything you'd like to say before we end the call? Alex Karp -- Chief Executive Officer We're doing it. We're doing it. And I'm sure you're enjoying this as much as I am. Let's not talk to analysts about the burden of being right, our burdens of investing in ontology, our burdens of actually looking at the math, the burden of reading what the Rule of 40 is, the burden of being honest about what an enterprise software company is, or the burden of explaining to your friends that you're really happy. Maybe we should just start talking about, I'm very happy to have you along for the journey and you are partners for us. Every Palantirian, we are crushing it. Everyone else is listening, we are dedicating our company, we have dedicated our company to the service of the West and the United States of America. And we're super proud of the role we play, especially in places we can't talk about. And we love our success in the U.S. and globally also. You know, we are doing in United Kingdom and many other places, Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world and when it's necessary to scare enemies and, on occasion, kill them. And we hope you're in favor of that. We hope you're enjoying being our partner. And we're really happy and very, very focused on what we're doing. Thank you for your time. Ana Soro -- Office of the Chief Financial Officer Thank you. That concludes the Q&A for today's call.

Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Matt, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. Before I get into the fourth-quarter earnings, let me first offer our thoughts and deepest condolences for the families and loved ones of those on board Jeju Air Flight 2216. We continue to support the airline and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board as they assist the South Korean authorities in the accident investigation. Now, turning to the fourth-quarter earnings. During the last call, I highlighted four areas critical to our recovery. And as the new year begins, we're making steady progress in all four areas. The first area, stabilizing the business. Following the resolution of the IAM strike, our commercial team has been executing a methodical plan to restart our factories within the framework of our safety management system. This included ensuring all manufacturing employees were current on their training and certifications prior to returning to work on the factory floor. We took time to rebalance the production line so that when we started up, we did so with a healthy production system. People are back to work and excited about the task ahead, and you can see the energy when you're on the factory floor. For the 737 MAX, we have sufficient parts inventory to enable producing at 38 a month, including fuselages, which were a pacing item prior to the strike. And all three of the production lines in Renton are now cycling. In the past quarter, we completed our safety management meeting with the FAA in which they reviewed our safety management system and our production status, including spending time on the factory floor. They reported that they saw significant improvements, and I'm pleased that we have an agreed-upon path for rate increases beyond 38 per month. It's all about adhering to our safety management system and a stable factory as measured through agreed-upon key performance indicators or KPIs. It's an early innings on the production ramp, and we need to stay disciplined on maintaining a stable production system but early signs are encouraging. The best news is that our customers are reporting that they are encouraged with what they're seeing as they monitor our production. Progress on the 787 also continues, and we finished last year at a production rate of five per month. Like the 737, we are working to ensure the 787 production system, including the supply chain, is stable prior to making the next rate increase. An important accomplishment to stabilize the business was to shore up our balance sheet. We are committed to recovering the business while maintaining an investment-grade credit rating and delivering for our shareowners. I think the demand for our offering last year speaks volumes about the market's confidence in our recovery. We're working across the supply chain, including the sub-tiers, to ensure readiness and stability with our production rates. Notably, supplier part shortages across all of our commercial programs are within their established control limits. We have instituted dedicated sessions with suppliers to provide insights as well as to promote two-way communication to stay aligned as we operate together as one extended production system. The second element of our recovery is to improve performance on our development programs. While the charges for the quarter in BDS are disappointing, I have had the opportunity to complete deep-dive EAC reviews on all the troubled programs. We are very focused on creating stability within the EACs so we stop this quarterly drumbeat of cost growth. This means being more proactive and clear-eyed on the risks and our estimates to complete the projects. While I know it doesn't show in this past quarter's performance, we're making progress in working with our customers to actively manage the contracts to achieve better outcomes for both parties. You've seen that we've entered into an MOA with the U.S. Air Force on the T-7A program, and we're in active discussions on a second MOA on that program, all focused on improving the performance of the program. We're also in active discussions with our customer on the VC-25B program to make the necessary changes to improve the program performance and delivery. The U.S. Air Force has termed this as an active management, which is a term I really like. We're focused on actively managing all of our problematic programs to improve the performance for the company and our customers. While I said there's no silver bullet on these fixed price programs, I do feel better about our ability to better manage the performance in 2025. On the commercial side, we continue to focus on getting the 737-7 and -10 as well as the 777X through certification. There are no updates to the timelines we've previously communicated on these programs. On the -7 and -10, we're still working through the testing phase focused on finalizing the icing design solution, which we plan to include in the certification program. Working closely with the FAA, especially in light of their leadership changes, will be a key focus area for us this year. The 777X is back in flight test, and we have a good handle on fixing the thrust link issue we uncovered. Now, moving to the third area, culture change. This will be a multiyear journey, but we're already making progress. Our leaders are getting more engaged with their teams and customers. We're having the frank discussions about what we need to change. In 2025, we'll be rebaselining our core values and behaviors to make our expectations perfectly clear to all our Boeing teammates. These will be incorporated into our leadership development program and become fundamental elements of our performance management system. Leadership promotions will be grounded, not only in what we get done, but how we get things done. We're going to help focus the teams on what it takes to make Boeing successful and promote a culture of unity and accountability by implementing a single enterprise score for all of our annual incentive plans. As I talk with employees, there's a growing swell of excitement around restoring trust and getting their Boeing back, and they want to be a part of this turnaround. So, the last area is building a new future for Boeing. While workforce reductions are always difficult, I'm pleased that we have been able to reduce layers of management and redundant overheads in our system. This will serve us well as we establish a less bureaucratic, more focused and agile operating environment for our future. We're preparing for the road ahead by continuing to make important investments in our core business while streamlining our portfolio in areas that aren't core to us. So, let me wrap up by saying that the markets we serve are robust and growing. Demand for our core commercial and defense products and services remains strong. Our backlog of more than half a trillion dollars clearly demonstrates the value of our portfolio, and we're focused on meeting our commitments and delivering safe, high-quality products to our customers. I do want to acknowledge and thank the incredibly talented employees at Boeing. Your resiliency and commitment give me confidence in our path forward. It's going to take all of us working together. Next, let me turn it over to Brian to cover the operating results. And after that, we'll be happy to take your questions. So, Brian, over to you. Brian J. West -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the total company financial performance for the quarter. Revenue was $15.2 billion, down 31%, primarily driven by lower commercial deliveries associated with the IAM work stoppage. The core loss per share was $5.90, primarily reflecting previously announced impacts of the IAM work stoppage and agreement, charges on certain defense programs, as well as costs associated with workforce reductions announced last year. Free cash flow was a use of $4.1 billion in the quarter, in line with the expectations shared at our last earnings call. Results were impacted by lower commercial deliveries and unfavorable working capital timing, primarily driven by the IAM work stoppage. Turning to the next page, I'll cover Boeing commercial airplanes. BCA delivered 57 airplanes in the quarter. Revenue was $4.8 billion, and operating margin was minus 43.9%, primarily reflecting previously announced impacts from the IAM work stoppage and agreement, including pre-tax charges of $1.1 billion on the 777X and 767 programs. Backlog in the quarter ended at $435 billion and includes more than 5,500 airplanes. Now, I'll give more color on the key programs. The 737 program delivered 36 airplanes in 4Q, including a step-up to 18 in December. And as of yesterday, we've delivered 33 airplanes in January with four days to go. On production, we restarted the factory in December and plan to gradually increase rate. We expect to be in a position to go above 38 per month later in the year. All three lines in our renting factory are cycling and monthly production is already in the low to mid-20s for January. More broadly on the master schedule, we continue to make adjustments as needed and manage supplier by supplier based on inventory levels. Over the past year, our buffer inventory has grown to promote stability across our production system. As production stabilizes and rates increase over time, we plan to deliberately return buffer inventory to more normal levels. The quarter ended with 55 737-8s built prior to 2023, the majority for customers in China and India, down five from 3Q, with about another 10 already delivered in January. Given the impact of the strike, we now expect to shut down the shadow factory midyear and deliver all the remaining airplanes to customers within the year. On the -7, -10, inventory levels were stable at approximately 35 airplanes and testing on the anti-icing design solution is ongoing with certification expected to follow later in the year. On the 787 program, we delivered 15 airplanes in the quarter as we made progress on working through production recovery plans for heat exchangers and delivery delays associated with seat certifications. The program exited the year at a production rate of five per month, and we recently announced plans to expand South Carolina operations as we prepared for anticipated future need of the commercial market. We are intent on ensuring the production system and the supply chain demonstrate stability prior to making the next increase on rates sometime this year. We ended the quarter with 25 airplanes in inventory built prior to 2023 that require rework, down five from last quarter. Our ability to finish the rework and shut down the shadow factory was also impacted by the work stoppage, and we expect to complete this work in early 2025. Finally, on 777X, as previously announced, the $900 million pre-tax charge primarily reflects higher estimated labor costs associated with finalizing the IAM agreement and will be incurred over the next several years. Flight testing recently resumed, and we still expect first delivery in 2026, and we will continue to follow the lead of the FAA as we move through certification. 777X inventory spend in 2024 finished at $2.6 billion as 4Q spending levels moderated due to the work stoppage. As noted previously, we expect the cash profile to look similar to prior development programs with the first year prior to first delivery, typically the largest use of cash driven by inventory build associated with the production ramp, which will unwind as deliveries accelerate. Moving on to the next page in Boeing defense and space. BDS booked $8 billion in orders during the quarter, including awards for 15 KC-46A tankers from the U.S. Air Force and seven P8A aircraft for the U.S. Navy, and the backlog ended at $64 billion. Revenue was $5.4 billion, down 20% year over year on volume and program charges, and operating margin was minus 41.9%. BDS delivered 34 aircraft and two satellites in the quarter, including the final T-7A EMD aircraft to the U.S. Air Force. The 15% of the portfolio comprised of fixed price development programs recorded a $1.7 billion pre-tax charge as previously announced. The fixed price development cost pressures were driven by the KC-46A and T-7A programs with KC-46 primarily reflecting higher estimated manufacturing costs, including the impacts of the IAM work stoppage agreement and T-7 driven by higher estimated production costs on contracts in 2026 and beyond. Roughly one-third of these new charges will work through the cash flows in the next few years with the remainder spread over the coming decade. Given the fixed price nature of these contracts, we'll continue to be transparent about impacts as we work to stabilize and mature these programs. We acknowledge that these are disappointing results. These are complicated development programs, and we remain focused on retiring risk each quarter and ultimately delivering these mission-critical capabilities to our customers. As Kelly shared, we continue to make progress in 4Q, including key order and delivery milestones already noted. Importantly, the updated acquisition approach for the T-7A is a proof point for how we are working with our customers to find better overall outcomes for both parties. And those efforts will continue as we work through other parts of the portfolio. On the 25% of the portfolio primarily comprised of fighter and satellite programs. Our fighter programs again recognized losses in 4Q due to disruptions associated with the F-15EX ramp-up and the F-18 production wind down. We also recognized impacts across satellites and a few other legacy platforms tied to development realities as we work to refresh the capabilities of these platforms to support our customer needs. The remaining 60% of revenues of the portfolio are generally performing in the mid- to high single-digit margin range, although the P8 commercial derivative program experienced margin compression in the fourth quarter due to the IAM work stoppage and agreement. While still more work in front of us, we continue to be confident that BDS margins can improve to high single-digit levels in the medium to longer term. The demand for our defense products remains very strong, supported by the threat environment confronting our nation and our allies. We still expect the business to return to historical performance levels as we stabilize production, execute on development programs, and transition to new contracts with tighter underwriting standards. Moving on to the next page, Boeing global services. BGS continued to perform well, delivering record operating margins in the quarter. The business received $6 billion in orders, and the backlog ended at $21 billion. Revenue was $5.1 billion, up 6%, primarily on higher commercial volume. Operating margin was a record 19.5% in the quarter, up 210 basis points compared to last year, with both our commercial and government businesses delivering double-digit margins. In the quarter, BGS secured awards for C-17 sustainment as well as a contract for F-15 Japan Superinerceptor upgrade and services from the U.S. Air Force. BGS is a terrific long-term franchise focused on profitable, capital-efficient service offerings and executing well with mid-single-digit revenue growth, mid-teen margins, and very high cash flow conversion. Turning to the next page, I'll cover cash and debt. On cash and marketable securities, we ended the quarter at $26.3 billion, primarily reflecting the successful $24 billion capital raise in October, partially offset by the free cash flow usage and debt repayment. The debt balance ended at $53.9 billion, down $3.8 billion in the quarter, driven by the early repayment of a $3.5 billion bond originally set to mature in 2025. Importantly, this prepayment derisks our 2025 maturity profile, resulting in $800 million of debt maturities remaining in the year. The company maintains access to $10 billion of revolving credit facilities, all of which remain undrawn. We remain committed to managing the balance sheet in a prudent manner with two main objectives: first, continue to prioritize the investment-grade rating; and second, allow the factory and supply chain to reset. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to further supplement the balance sheet as we make certain portfolio decisions through the course of the year. Turning to the next page, I'll cover the total financial company results for the full year. Full-year revenue was $66.5 billion, down 14% year over year, driven by lower commercial deliveries, including impacts of the IAM work stoppage. The core loss per share was $20.38, down from prior year, primarily on lower deliveries and commercial and defense program charges, including impacts of the IAM work stoppage and agreement. Free cash flow was a $14.3 billion usage for the year, down versus prior year on commercial deliveries and unfavorable working capital timing, including the impact of the work stoppage. Stepping back, let me provide some additional context on 2025 free cash flow. 2025 will be an important year in our recovery. And while we still expect it to be a use of cash, we anticipate a significant improvement over 2024. Within 2025, we expect 1Q free cash flow will be a usage and similar to 4Q '24, driven by continued working capital headwinds as we ramp production as well as normal seasonality. We still expect the first half to be a use of cash with the second half turning positive and accelerating as we exit 2025. Capex investments stepped up last year and could increase by approximately $500 million in 2025 to support planned growth across both the commercial and defense businesses. Importantly, we expect to exit the year with real momentum in the business as we return to normal production rates. This outlook will be underwritten by a few critical factors: increasing 737 production rates through the year; moving 787 steadily toward its long-term production rates; liquidating our legacy 737 and 787 inventory and shutting down both shadow factories; strategically investing in the business, including the 777X production ramp and capex to support planned growth across the portfolio; improving our defense business as we continue to mature the fixed price development programs and work to transition recently challenged programs with our renewed focus on disciplined program management and stabilizing the business; and finally, continuing to demonstrate strong performance across our services business. Broadly, the markets we serve continue to be significant, and our backlog of more than half a trillion dollars demonstrates that our product portfolio is positioned to win. Long term, these fundamentals underpin our confidence as we continue to manage the business with a long-term view built on safety, quality, and delivering for our customers. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, in the interest of time, we are asking that you limit yourself to one single-part question. And our first question is from the line of David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead. David E. Strauss -- Analyst Thank you. Good morning. Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, David. David E. Strauss -- Analyst Kelly, I wanted to ask how you view the restart on MAX, how that's gone. You mentioned some of the -- you mentioned KPPs that you have with the -- or KPIs that you have with the FAA. Can you maybe elaborate on what exactly those are, how close you are to hitting what's necessary to get to go above 38 a month? And then, Brian, can you just give us an idea of what to expect for all-in MAX and 787 deliveries in 2025? Thanks. Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, David. So, let me talk about the production start-up on MAX. So, as you know, we came out of the strike and didn't actually jump right on building aircraft. We spent time training the workforce, getting them all up to speed, but also really, as I said, balancing the line, which is really important, starting the line up in a stable manner. And it already is paying dividends. We're seeing the production process come back very well, and I feel pretty good about where we are right now with the production rate. Remember that we've got a significant amount of inventory, both in airplanes and in supply parts. So, I don't see any constraints right now from the supply chain for us in ramping up the 737 to the 38 a month rate. And notably, the work at Spirit has -- during the strike has really paid off. That team has done a great job of improving the overall performance and quality of the fuselages, which are going to help flow through the factory. So, as I said, it's early days, but I feel really good. And I think our deliberate plan is going to pay dividends for us going forward. Brian J. West -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer David, a little bit on how to think about 737 deliveries for the year. We're not putting out formal guidance. It's a little too early for that. But let's just talk about a framework for the year. So, January is off to a very solid start, and deliveries should be in the high 30s for the month. Now, keep in mind, some of these airplanes are the benefit of clearing the delivery center ramp that had accumulated in the November, December time frame. So, there's an advantage of a nice tailwind entering the year. We expect February will be lighter because there's fewer manufacturing days and also the timing of the factory restart and then March is likely to be better than February as we begin to get more predictability. So, as we've said, the first half is going to reflect our gradual steady restart of the factory. And the second half is likely going to benefit from achieving higher production rates, which include the 38 per month target and possibly higher based on approval from the FAA as Kelly mentioned. So, as we sit here today, we've got a lot of work in front of us. 2025, in some ways, could look like 2023, maybe a bit better if things go our way. Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, David. Let me come back also and talk about the six KPIs that you asked about. So, these are KPIs that we've agreed with the FAA on what the threshold is and where the control limits we want to operate. And these are what we've collectively determined will measure the stability of our production system. I'll quickly tell you what the six are. They're NOE, notice of escape hours; shortages, part shortages; employee proficiency; rework by line; travel to work at rollout; and ticketing performance. And so, I will say it's a little bit early because we have a lot of inventory yet of planes that were in process that we're going through. But early indications is that all the KPIs are looking and trending in the right direction. So, I feel so far, so good, but it will be important to see and continue to measure these KPIs as we continue to ramp up. And remember, we need to get to 38 and show stability at 38 with these KPIs. And we won't go to the FAA for a rate increase. We won't request one if we don't see these KPIs performing the way that we want to. And so, I think we've got a disciplined approach. As I said in my remarks, I'm pleased that it's pretty well grounded in facts and data. So, there's no subjectivity here as far as what it's going to take. But we got to perform. And Stephanie and the team are clearly focused on performing to these KPIs. Operator Thank you. And the next question is from Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment -- Analyst Yes. Good morning, Kelly and Brian. Hey, Brian, maybe if you could walk us through a little bit on the free cash flow dynamics for 2025. I know you called out a few things, some of the moving parts, but just thinking about working capital headwinds or 777X spend or BDS losses. We've been estimating about a $5 billion outflow this year. I think it's a little above the consensus of four. Anything to highlight that you could help us maybe that potentially could be reduced that outflow? Or how are you thinking? I know you gave us the first half versus second-half dynamics, but anything else that you could provide more color on? Thanks. Brian J. West -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure, Peter. So, 2025 free cash flow is largely going to be consistent with what we had said at our October earnings call with the two adjustments that I noted, which is capex a little bit higher based on some growth programs that we're anxious to invest in and the impact of a few hundred million based on the updated BDS charges. So, it's consistent with those two adjustments. Now, in terms of profile, as we've discussed and you mentioned, the first half will be negative. The second half will be positive. It will be a net usage in the calendar year. But importantly, positive momentum as we accelerate cash flows exiting the year that sets us up very nicely for 2026. Now, in terms of the levers, the first half of the year, BCA is going to be negative driven by the working capital usage and continued investment in the 777X program. BDS is going to be negative due to the prior-period charges running through as well as normal seasonality as it pertains to customer receipts. And BGS is going to be nice and steady contributor in the first half. As we go into the second half, BCA is expected to flip positive because then we will get the benefit of the working capital as deliveries accelerate while we still invest in the 777X program. Again, it's all going to be a function of our ability to work that -- those higher deliveries in the back half. Now, BDS is going to move positive despite a continued drag from the charges, primarily from the benefit of favorable receipt timing that's natural and seasonal in that part of the business. And then BGS, we tend to have better second half than first half. So, it's going to be a nice steady but growing profile for the second half. And as I mentioned, the capex is going to be a bit higher, but for good reasons because that's all about growth. So, in terms of the numbers that you described, that's a reasonable ballpark or what we're aiming at, and we're managing all the levers and keep you updated as we move through the course of the year. Peter Arment -- Analyst Appreciate it. Thanks. Operator The next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu -- Analyst Hey, good morning. Kelly, maybe on the fixed price development programs within BDS. It seems like the timing to stabilize those keeps getting pushed to the right. How are you actively managing those programs, and what are you looking to change? And then, Brian, related to that, how do you correlate those charges? I think you mentioned one-third is now. Can you maybe size that cash outflow for '25? Is it 3 billion related to BDS and then 1 billion in '26? Does the business become breakeven in '27? And when does it become positive? Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer OK. Sheila, I'll go first and then ask Brian to follow up. Yes. So, obviously, the quarter was disappointing here on the fixed price development programs. But as I said in my remarks, we're very actively now working all these programs with our customers. And we've got -- the U.S. Air Force is clearly working with us to find a better path forward on these programs, both for us and for them. So, derisking through this active management process is different, and it's -- we still have to convert it these MOAs, which are memorandum of agreements, we have to convert them to contract changes. So, we're in early stages, but the customers are working with us in that regard. And then I think just as I said, taking a real clear look at the EACs and the estimates to complete and making sure that we're reflecting the realities of the risks that we have. And so, I'm very hopeful that we're going to see a much more stable performance here this next year. But again, we're not done with these until we're done with these, and they are fixed price. So, we've got to continue to work at this. Our team is very, very focused on program management discipline, making sure we're managing the tasks at hand, but a lot of work yet to do, Sheila, on these. So, I think we're making progress, but I can't -- certainly can't claim victory yet. Brian J. West -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer Sheila, in terms of the cash flow, you're correct. The new charge of 1.7 billion, we characterize about a third of that is going to be over the next three years. So, it's a little bit front-end loaded. So, a few million dollars -- a few hundred million dollars of pressure that we see in 2025 versus what we said back in October. Now, in terms of your broader question on the full way the charges are going to tend to flow through, I think BDS for 2025 from cash flow performance is going to look a little bit like 2023. And then once we get through 2025, it will be in a much different spot because a lot of that headwind from the charge will be behind us. And when we get exactly to breakeven positive, won't be this year, but can't wait to have that discussion as we move out beyond exiting this year. Sheila Kahyaoglu -- Analyst Got it. So, breakeven could be possible in '26 or maybe '27? Brian J. West -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, for sure. Sheila Kahyaoglu -- Analyst Got it. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question is from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ronald Epstein -- Analyst Hey, yeah. Good morning, guys. Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Ron. Ronald Epstein -- Analyst Kelly, could you talk about how you're thinking about Boeing's portfolio? I mean, there's been a fair amount of press about maybe some things could be up for sale, maybe not. What's core? What isn't? So, like the way I've been thinking about it, one of the things that's been talked about is maybe selling Jeppesen. But on one hand, maybe that's a good idea. But on the other hand, that puts Boeing's name in pretty much every cockpit of every airplane on the planet. And is that a bad thing? So, I mean, how are you thinking about it? Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well -- so, first of all, Ron, we've been through the detailed portfolio review, which was one of my early tasks, and that's complete, highlighted areas that are questionable to our core. And we go through an analysis to look at each of those areas, and we're in process in that. As I look at this, here's how I would think about it, Ron. This is not going to be a major restructuring of The Boeing Company. The core business that you see us in and we're going to continue to be in those core areas. But there are some areas -- you named one. There are some areas where we can streamline the organization, or we may be better off focusing our energy elsewhere. And we'll be actioning those over the coming months and year. The only thing I would say is that as you look at those, part of that decision process is what do you do with something. In some cases, you have potential that you could sell it and there are buyers. In some cases, that may not be a viable approach. We may want to just not continue with the next phase of the project or something like that. So, we're going through that. But I think if I give you any guidance, think of it as more pruning the portfolio, not cutting down the tree. Ronald Epstein -- Analyst Got it. Got it. And you'd expect maybe we'll know more about this in the next 12 to 18 months, something like that? Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yep. Look, I can't really speak about individual portfolio decision areas. But as they come along, obviously, you'll see what we're doing there. Ronald Epstein -- Analyst Got it. Got it. All right. Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Myles Walton -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning. So, on the supply chain and maybe the Spirit integration, how key is that to your ability to get to 38 and then get above 38? And then if you could just quickly touch on the 787 and the supply chain constraints you're observing there, specifically on interiors and if heat exchangers are still the issue? And how quickly you expect those to release within the context of 2025? Thanks. Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, Myles. So, look, on Spirit, I don't view Spirit fuselages as a constraint right now for us to get to rate 38. As I mentioned in the remarks, they've done a really, really nice job of improving the quality of the fuselage and the flow of the fuselages. So, we're in really, really good shape on fuselages with Spirit, which sets up a very successful integration. We've got a team of Boeing folks at Spirit working hand in glove with them as they improve their production processes. And I think that sets us up well for the upcoming integration, which will happen sometime still we're projecting middle of the year. Relating to 787 inventory -- or I mean, supply chain, as Brian said in his remarks, I think we're working through the heat exchangers. We still need some additional improvement there, but all the all the improvements look good. Seats remain a challenge for us. And it's not the seat. We call it seats, but it's the monuments really that go around the seats and the integration of the IFE and the certification associated with that. And we're still challenged in getting through cert on some new of type seats on 787. We got to plan on that. It's really a customer-by-customer basis. One of the things we're looking at for the future is we've got to spread these seat -- new seat configurations. We call them Code 1s. We've got to spread these Code 1s out to allow ourselves and the regulators more time to get through the certification. These things are complex. They're not a seat -- they're a complex monument. And particularly as we move to doors. Doors are a real challenge in the certification process. And so, we've got to work through some of that. We've got a team really focused on that, but I think it's going to continue to be a challenge for those 787 deliveries where we have a new seat configuration that needs to be certified. So, for example, Lufthansa, we've got a lot of completed airplanes that are held up still on seats, and we're working through that. Hopefully, we'll get through that this year, and we'll have a more successful seat integration program as we ramp 787 up. Myles Walton -- Analyst OK. And, Brian, the delivery number for 787 for this year? Seventy-five, 80, is that a doable number? Brian J. West -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, as we've said, we're at five per month. We want to get to seven sometime this year. And we've got, call it, high teens coming out of inventory. So, when you add all that together, for sure, maybe a little bit better. Myles Walton -- Analyst Great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And our next question is from Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Scott Deuschle -- Analyst Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Kelly, could you characterize the pace at which you think the business can liquidate 777X aircraft from inventory once EIS hits? And then are you expecting the first-class cabin seats to be certified for the 777X launch customers by the time 777X itself is type certified? Or is there any risk of delay there on seating as well? Thank you. Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Let me take the seating first, and then I'll ask Brian to do the liquidation. So, actually, the first delivery -- 777X delivery is also to Lufthansa, which is where I just mentioned, we have had seat and continue to have seat challenges. So, I guess the good news, bad news is we've had seat challenges, but we do know what those challenges are for Lufthansa deliveries. Now, 777X interior in general is a more complex interior, but that's baked into our overall certification program for the aircraft. So, we got time to go work the seat certification issues, and we've learned from our 787, what those issues are. So, I think we'll be able to manage that for the initial deliveries. Brian J. West -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer And, Scott, in terms of cash flows, as is typical on a new program, heavy cash usage the year before EIS, which is going to be for 2025. In terms of 2026, when it goes into service, keep in mind, the initial airplanes are going to be change in corp airplanes, which are going to be not high cash flow airplanes. But once you get through those and you get out of 2026 and then 2027, you're really going to start to generate free cash flows, and that's going to accelerate as deliveries accelerate. So, we're going to be set up very nicely once we get through EIS. Scott Deuschle -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman -- Analyst Hey. Thanks very much, and good morning. Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Seth. Seth Seifman -- Analyst Good morning. I guess I wanted to follow up on maybe two other items as we think about the cash flow this year. You talked about winding down the shadow factories, both of them, I guess. That was something that in the past, we've talked about as a key enabler of enhanced profitability. How do we think about factoring that into the cash flow improvement that we're seeing this year? And then also any -- the financial implications and cash flow implications of Spirit integration in the second half? Brian J. West -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. Let me take a stab at that one. So, as you know, we've got two shadow factories. The 737 has largely been in Moses Lake. The 787 has been the joint verification work in Everett. And there is a lot of labor that go into reworking those airplanes. As it pertains to the 787, we expect the very early part of this year, that work will be done. Now, we won't deliver all the airplanes this year because we've got some customer fleet planning things we need to fit in with, so that will bleed over into next year. But the factory itself and the labor associated with that is going to be over the early part of this year, and labor has already started to move toward other first-run production. On the 737, equally, Moses Lake, we've begun to take labor and move it from Moses Lake into Renton. We expect to shut that shadow factory down by midyear. And then the corresponding deliveries will tail off toward the end of this year. So, it's been a long journey. We look forward to that. It's all contemplated into our -- the numbers I discussed and described in terms of how cash flows are going to move this year. I would say that over time, the benefit you're going to start to see is a margin improvement at BCA because you don't have these two very expensive shadow factories up and running anymore. They'll be done. So, that will be something that will be 2026 and beyond. As it pertains to Spirit integration, as Kelly said, we're anxious. One, they're doing a great job. We're anxious to get it closed. We're not really describing what the financial impact on that is until we close. But the good news is that we're on pace, it remains strategically important, and the team is holding up really nicely at a pivotal point as we ramp production. Seth Seifman -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And the next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak -- Analyst Hey, good morning, everyone. Brian J. West -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer Good morning, Noah. Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Noah. Noah Poponak -- Analyst What is it about the T-7A specifically that it keeps having so much cost creep? And I guess, Kelly, as you look at this portfolio, everything in defense is complex, and I appreciate the amount of work that goes into these. But I think there's been some investor confusion around the dollar size relative to the perceived complexity of these programs. So, what is causing the cost creep, and how do you fix it? And you mentioned the updated acquisition approach on that program specifically. Can you detail that a little bit further? Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, the fundamental on T-7 is a fixed price development with a large fixed price production, and we did not have our supply chains back to back in the fixed price production. So, it's much larger than what you would normally see because very rarely do you see where you have -- first of all, where you have a fixed price development, but certainly don't have multi years of fixed price production. We've been burned on that on the tanker program. And clearly, that's been a challenge for us on T-7A. So, we've taken our medicine. We're not going to do that anymore. Now, specific to the MOA, what we're doing is making changes. The Air Force wants some additional test aircraft. That will allow us to eliminate concurrency. And by concurrency, what I mean is we're still -- we've got -- we're building production airplanes while we're testing and certifying the design. And that's a disaster because every time you come up with a change that comes out of that, you've got to go ripple that change back through the production process, either in process or airplanes are complete. So, the major milestone with the MOA 1 that we've got with the Air Force really helps us get more aircraft into the test program, eliminates concurrency risk for us going forward. So, it's not necessarily good news from an EAC write-up, but it's certainly going to eliminate risk that we are staring at on the program. And then on MOA 2, which is we're in active discussion with them, it's also on making some changes to equipment purchased by us versus purchased by the Air Force directly, which will also help them with their logistics support plans, but also derisk our escalation risk associated with those commodity sets. So, that's the type of stuff we've got to get better at is working those things with the customer. But the fundamental to this is a fixed price development with a fixed price production option and not having your supply chain back to back is not a good recipe. And we've learned, and we're not going to do that anymore. Noah Poponak -- Analyst So, appreciate learning that lesson and not doing that again. But if you live with the decisions that were made on the existing programs for -- until the end of those programs, how do you have confidence in the cash flow improvement in the segment in the near term that you've expressed here? Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well -- so, I mean, we do an estimate at complete and look at the estimate to complete. So, much of the charges that we're taking are not actual charges for overruns to date. They're anticipated charges for increased cost from our supply chain. So, we are getting the supply chain back to back in fixed price right now. Our goal is to get that 100% done. But as we're doing that, we're having to recognize the cost increases from the supply chain. So, that's why I have confidence we're getting closer to having that all back to back. So, we've eliminated eliminate that large risk going forward. But obviously, it's resulting in pretty significant charges as we weave through that. Brian J. West -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer And, Noah, what I would say long term, our objective has always been to get the 15% of the portfolio that's wrapped up in these fixed price development programs, including T-7 to not be a drag to just be neutral, right, to be at the zero profit and not consume cash. The rest of the portfolio, when we get the 25% fighter satellites performing as they should, given their legacy products and 60% of the portfolio that's doing quite well. If we can get that all moving in the right direction, that gets you to the path to high single-digit margins in BDS like they should be even with a 50% of the portfolio that isn't going to do anything for us. And that's fine because long term, outside of the planning period in front of us, those development programs, including tanker, including MQ, including T-7, there are longer-term opportunities with market demand, particularly internationally that actually could have us do a little bit better that we're not counting on. But longer term, those are the reasons why we stay in these programs and deliver capabilities to the customers they absolutely need it. Noah Poponak -- Analyst Appreciate all that detail. Thank you. Brian J. West -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Operator The next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Douglas Harned -- Analyst Good morning. Thank you. It sounds like you're in a very good position right now to get to the 38 a month level given that you're already at -- in the 20s on the MAX. But historically, upward rate breaks have been pretty challenging. And when you look beyond the 38 a month to 42 and subsequent rate breaks, how are you thinking about what you need to get done to make sure that you have the right team in place to make those rate breaks happen given that a lot of people have left over the past five years or so? Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. You know, as I look at that, I'm less concerned about our -- the people resources to do that. I think we're in good shape. Once we get to these higher-rate breaks, the most important thing is that we have the supply chain ready and mature. And one of the things we're doing right now because we've forecasted rates that the supply chain has built to, and then we haven't met those rates. So, I want to make sure that supply chain isn't making independent decisions on readiness for these out-year production rates and continuing to invest in the capacity that they need to supply us. So, we've started -- as I said in the opening remarks, open communication. And what that means is at various levels, including CEO level, we're making sure that they are investing in their supply chain. And if they're not, they're talking to us about why, and we're working through what we do to make sure that we don't get to a point where we're ready to get to the next rate increase and the supply chain stability is not going to be there. Now, remember, these KPIs that I talked about earlier, those are going to stay with us for each rate increase. So, we won't make a rate increase if we -- well, we won't be approved for it, but we won't request it if our production system isn't showing that these metrics are indicating stability. So, we got to continue to work that. But I'm not too sure or too concerned about the overall staffing level of the production resources. It's probably more focusing on the supply chain for that growth. Brian J. West -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer And, Doug, the other good news is the facilitization. We're cycling at three lines in Renton, as Kelly mentioned, and we've got that fourth line in Everett. And that is going to create a lot of flexibility for us as we think about those rate breaks. So, not only is it labor, parts, supply chain, etc., but the facilitization is there as well. So, we feel pretty confident the tools are all there in place. And of course, the demand is there, which is beneficial. Douglas Harned -- Analyst And is there anything you would point to in the supply chain that you particularly want to focus on to make sure you don't run into an issue when you take your next break up? Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, not in particular. I think there's multiple areas that we'll work with all the -- all of our Tier 1 OEMs probably have a commodity in their portfolio that we want to make sure. But it's generally more in the commodities where there's long lead components like forgings, castings, that kind of stuff. I'm less worried about electronics. That's a pretty easy area to scale. But it's where you have to invest in that second and third tier supply chain that we want to make sure that they're making those investments and they haven't hedged their bets and don't believe we're going to build the airplanes and then we find out that we don't have the capacity there. And one of the things that we're working very closely with GE on is that the overall -- making sure they understand our overall market demand as well as the aftermarket demand for the engines as well because they've got a big challenge with supporting our rate increases -- our competitor rate increases and managing the aftermarket. And I work very closely with Larry and his team to make sure we stay aligned. Douglas Harned -- Analyst Very good. Thank you. Operator The next question is from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead. Jason Gursky -- Analyst Hey, good morning. Brian, one for you, and then just a quick one for Kelly as well. Brian, for you. BCA margins, you took some charges this quarter on the programs that were in forward loss positions. I suspect though that we'll have some impacts on the margins for some of your more profitable programs as well given all those costs. I'm just kind of curious, what does the margin cadence look like for BCA over the next six to eight quarters as you're ramping in production? When do we get the chance here to flip to the positive range on margins? And then just kind of the long-term implications of these cost increases coming out of the labor strike, that kind of thing on the financial model and what BCA margins are going to skate to over time once you're up at those targeted production rates. And then, Kelly, just really quickly for you. I received the company's corporate calendar. It's got the X-66 on the cover. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit on that aircraft and kind of what it means to the company and kind of your general views on that development program for NASA. Thanks. Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Let me take the latter part of that first. So, it's an important technology development program. It's very challenging. It's taking some dedicated resources that I think are learning new things and exploring new technologies for us. And then we'll look at what comes out of that and how that factors into our next airplane. So, it's an important project that we're working on. We've got some funding we're investing, but we've also got some funding there to support us. So, we'll continue to explore that exciting opportunity and see what that portends for the future airplane. I will tell you, I've sat through with the team, and there's some exciting stuff that we're learning from that program. And so, I think we want to continue that. Brian J. West -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer And, Jason, in terms of BCA margins. So, as we think about 2025, margins will be negative. They'll be less negative as we move through the next few quarters as we exit the year. And then beyond that, we're going to expect them to get better in 2026. We're not going to try to characterize it quite yet. It's too early. But in terms of the longer-term profile, the IAM agreement did put pressure. But keep in mind, we're talking about a cost that's less than 5% of the airplane. Now, it's a little bit of pressure, but I characterize that versus the massive productivity benefit that we're going to enjoy by having two shadow factories behind us and a rate ramp that's going to accelerate productivity naturally. So, it doesn't disrupt our margin expectations over the long term. A lot of work in order to get this pressure behind us, but plenty of levers that we think work toward our favor. It doesn't necessarily disrupt the long term. Jason Gursky -- Analyst OK. Thanks. Operator Thank you. The next question is from Gavin Parsons from UBS. Please go ahead. Gavin Parsons -- Analyst Thanks, guys. Good morning. Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer Good morning. Gavin Parsons -- Analyst Just wanted to follow up on that BCA margin question a little bit with the price side of that, the price/cost mix. How much of MAX 10 starting to contribute helps drive the margin up? How much of kind of escalators or realized price increases over the coming years? And then a quick clarification on inventory. Just how much cash is tied up in both completed aircraft and WIP? Thank you. Brian J. West -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer So, in terms of the profile for BCA, of course, we've got a backlog that is in place that has embedded escalation in it. That hasn't changed. That's good. And in terms of our supply contracts, they're vastly signed up until end of this decade. So, that doesn't really disrupt the near term or even the medium term per se. I will tell you, though, as we move forward, we will expect any kind of inflation pressure to be offset by an expectation that we continue to drive productivity. So, we think we'll be able to manage that mix. More to come as we move out of this year and get into more of that normal stable position. But nothing right now would suggest it's going to disrupt that long-term margin outlook that BCA has enjoyed historically. And of course, some of the mix benefits that you mentioned, both the 10 on the 37 and the 10 on the 87 are going to be natural tailwinds, including the consolidation of Charleston that we've always talked about and we still feel very good about as we move toward normal production rates. So, more work to do, but no big disruptions we see as we sit here today. In terms of the inventory, we've got $87.5 billion worth of inventory in the company right now. That is too much. Now, it's been an investment and stability, and we are committed to make that investment so that we can get the factories in the right spot. But there will be a point when those inventories will begin to liquidate and not only see the productivity benefit. The working capital benefit will be something that we're very interested in seeing, and then we will begin to lower buffer rates that we put in place deliberately as we get to more predictability. So, that is the big cash flow benefit that we're going to see over the next couple of years-ish. And it's all because we've been sitting on this big investment that we look forward to having unwind with deliveries. And that's what we're focused the team on out in Seattle. Gavin Parsons -- Analyst Thank you. Matt Welch -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thanks, Gavin. Lois, we have time for one final question. Operator Thank you. And that question is coming from the line of Gautam Khanna. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna -- Analyst Yeah. Thanks for the detail on the call. I just wanted to put a finer point on when you expect to be at 38 a month in terms of deliveries on the 37 and when realistically you could get to 42. I know you mentioned this year, but if you could put a finer point within the year. Thank you. Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer You know what, I'm not putting a finer point on it, both externally nor internally. We're going to go to that rate when the KPIs say that we're going to go to that rate. And we'll just see how that plays out. I mean, like I said, things look encouraging so far. We've got a lot of work yet to do, and we'll make those rate increases, hopefully sometime so that I do want to get through the rate 38 approval and move to that next rate of 42 -- get through the approval this year and get to that 42% sometime toward the end of the year. But we'll put exact dates on it once we know and feel better about our KPIs and how the trends are indicating. Gautam Khanna -- Analyst Thank you. Kelly Ortberg -- President and Chief Executive Officer That's part of why we're not providing guidance yet. I think we've got a little bit more work to do to see the system gets stable before I feel like we can provide guidance to you that we have a reasonable expectation that we'll be able to meet that guidance. So, more to come as we mature. Things are off to a good start, but we've got a lot of work yet to do. Operator And that completes The Boeing Company's fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call.

DXC Technology (DXC -0.90%) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Aug 08, 2024, 5:00 p.m. ET Operator Hello, and welcome to the DXC Technology Q1 fiscal year 2025 earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Roger Sachs, VP of investor relations. You may begin. Roger Sachs -- Vice President, Investor Relations Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to DXC Technology's first-quarter earnings conference call. We hope you had a chance to review our earnings release posted to the IR section of DXC's website. Speakers on today's call are Raul Fernandez, our president and CEO; and Rob Del Bene, our chief financial officer. Our agenda will be as follows. Raul will provide an overview of our results and an update on our strategic initiatives. Rob will then walk you through our financial performance for the quarter as well as update you on our full-year outlook and provide some thoughts on our fiscal second quarter. Raul and Rob will then take your questions. Certain comments we make on today's call will be forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on the call. A discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. We do not undertake any obligation to update or release any revisions to any forward-looking statements. Also, during this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information to our investors. In accordance with SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most direct comparable GAAP measures. These reconciliations can be found in the tables included in today's earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Raul. Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Roger. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call. I'm pleased with our first quarter results that came in ahead of our expectations on top line, adjusted EBIT margin, and adjusted diluted EPS. Our performance is an early testament to the improved execution by our teams along many fronts. Our teams are focused on designing and implementing solutions that embed engineering skills, AI, and industry expertise to capture opportunities in an expanding addressable technology market. As our enhanced operating model gains traction, we believe it positions us well to deliver greater value for our customers, improve financial performance, and drive long-term shareholder value. Specifically, during the quarter, total revenue declined 4% year over year on an organic basis, adjusted EBIT margin of 6.9% expanding 40 basis points year over year, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.74 was up 17% year over year, and we generated free cash flow of $45 million versus negative $75 million during the first quarter of last year. In light of ongoing market uncertainty, we continue to see cautious behavior for many of our customers. This has resulted in an ongoing restrained discretionary spending environment on short-term project work, down modestly from the prior year, across both our Global Business Services and Global Infrastructure Services segments. Therefore, along with our selective new approach to deals, overall bookings during the first quarter remained under pressure. We had factored this lower level of bookings going into the full-year outlook that we provided this past May. We are revamping our go-to-market approach within our sales organizations. A few examples include dedicated client partners having significant domain expertise tied to specific clients and industries; updated compensation structure that includes bookings, revenue, and profitability, as well as elevated incentives to expand client relationships; and a clear delineation between existing and new logo account teams. We are beginning to see some early success from our efforts. Our pipeline has expanded nicely, largely driven by new deal inflows in Consulting and Engineering Services, which is our largest segment. Additionally, within our pipe, we are seeing a greater mix of larger deals progressing to the later stages of the sales cycle. Although these engagements are expected to have a lesser contribution to near-term revenue, we believe they provide a solid foundation for long-term stability. Let me take a minute to quickly highlight details of two new deal wins led by our technology and engineering expertise, together with deep vertical domain knowledge. For ContiTech, one of the world's leading industrial suppliers, our Consulting and Engineering Services business is leading the effort to consolidate multiple SAP legacy ERP systems to a new SAP S/4HANA platform. This migration allows greater process optimization across the company and provides timely, actionable insights for strategic decision-making to drive business performance. Within our Cloud and Infrastructure business, we recently entered into a long-term IBM mainframe-managed service agreement with First Horizon Bank for ongoing management and support. During the first quarter, we initiated several tactical actions under our enhanced operating model. Within GBS, where we help clients accelerate digital transformation, we are doing the following. Last quarter, we consolidated our Analytics, Engineering, and Applications business and now call it Consulting and Engineering Services under industry veteran, Howard Boville. This streamlines our offering structure and enhances our ability to design and go to market with more standardized, scalable enterprise applications. Additionally, under Howard's leadership, we've aligned the business to five verticals: financial services, automotive and manufacturing, healthcare and life sciences, airlines, and public sector, where we have significant domain expertise, allowing us to develop very targeted solutions to address industry-specific challenges. To enhance our operating and delivery model, during the quarter, we began to execute on the following initiatives: optimizing our global delivery network to quickly identify and leverage the best available talent in geographic regions; increasing adoption of gen AI capabilities for application development, testing, and maintenance; implementing a new workforce planning management system to better manage resources in all market conditions through predictive modeling; and restructuring our account pyramids to drive further offshore delivery. Within Insurance Software and BPS, we continue to explore a range of opportunities to accelerate the already strong performance of our market-leading Insurance Software and Services unit that generates more than $1 billion of annual revenue. We anticipate providing you a further update in the near future. Moving to GIS, which represents our portfolio of technology solutions. We are bringing together our infrastructure, security, and modern workplace teams under the trusted leadership of Chris Drumgoole, a tenured DXC executive. This better enables us to develop and deliver unique and mission-critical secure technology solutions to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Our integrated GIS workforce of almost 50,000 practitioners across 70 countries will be one of the largest, most experienced, and best-equipped in the marketplace. These professionals have over 49,000 certifications across AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure as well as specialized security technologies. While each of our offerings will continue to innovate and maintain distinct market identities, this combination helps that our solutions are designed, built, sold, and operated to work together seamlessly. Specifically, within Cloud, ITO, and Security, we are executing on the following: developing a targeted set of offerings, investing in and growing top-performing accounts and winding down select nonperforming accounts, and driving deeper penetration of our AI data-driven intelligent automation platform that helps customers quickly detect and resolve IT issues and prevents future problems before they occur. Within Modern Workplace, we're continuing to implement AI and gen AI tools to enhance the capability of our chatbots to handle increasing inbound service requests. Additionally, during the quarter, we took steps to improve our operational efficiency. We began to consolidate, standardize, and eliminate redundant processes across our sales, business, and account operations through the implementation of a global shared services model. As part of our consolidation plan, we are in the final stages of upgrading our targeted ERP system to S/4HANA and expect to start an initial phase of migrations later in this year. Revamping our go-to-market approach as well as the actions we are taking across GBS, GIS, and our internal infrastructure enables us to reduce overhead and redirect investments toward more value-added, front-end initiatives. The impact is already being felt as we are realizing a notable improvement in delivery metrics and overall quality of our services that has resulted in higher client satisfaction Net Promoter Scores. I want to now take a moment to briefly comment on an area that I'm deeply passionate about: protecting intellectual property. This mission has been a cornerstone in my career as a leader, investor, and entrepreneur. At DXC, we are defining how to embrace innovation ethically and responsibly, helping our customers navigate digital transformation with confidence. We believe our commitment to IP protection represents a cornerstone to company advancement and stakeholder value. We also take extensive measures to safeguard our own technology while ensuring excellence. As such, I'm very pleased with the recent favorable judgment by the United States District Court, which endorses our commitment to responsible innovation and protecting our intellectual property from certain actions by one of our competitors, TCS. Before concluding, I want to express my gratitude to our global team who diligently worked with customers that were recently impacted by the CrowdStrike software update that led to widespread disruption. Our response demonstrated that our dedication to our customers goes well beyond transforming their operations. We assembled a dedicated team that quickly implemented a recovery plan, leveraging our extensive experience with similar incidents. Our technicians worked directly with end customers, guiding them through complex restoration processes to keep customers' operations up and running. For example, our efforts enabled a regional airline carrier, a global petroleum company, a worldwide logistics company, and a global manufacturing company to have their operations restored shortly after the event, minimizing disruption. To conclude, we believe our greatest near-term opportunities will come from being much more effective across the life cycle of capturing new business, solutioning it correctly, incorporating proper pricing, and creating better economic models for renewals. Our success will be defined by our ability to execute against these opportunities. And I am determined to drive the transformation of our company as quickly as possible. Now, let me turn the call over to Rob to review our first-quarter results. Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Raul, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll review details of our first quarter results and then provide you with our latest thinking regarding our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook, along with our view for the second quarter. Please note that the additional financial information we have historically provided as an appendix to our slide presentation is now being made available as an Excel file for your convenience. You can download it from the IR section of DXC's website immediately following our call. Additionally, given our leadership changes Raul discussed, we have reassessed how we will report results. Moving forward, we will continue to disclose revenue, book-to-bill ratios, and profitability by our two segments: Global Business Services and Global Infrastructure Services. Within GBS, we will now report revenue and book-to-bill ratios for Consulting and Engineering Services as well as for our Insurance Software and BPS offerings. Under GIS, we will now disclose revenue and book-to-bill ratios for Cloud, ITO, and Security and our Modern Workplace offerings. And now on to our results. Total revenue of $3.2 billion declined 4% year over year on an organic basis, which was better than our expectation. GBS revenue, which now represents 52% of total revenue, increased 1% year over year on an organic basis. GIS revenue, which represents 48% of total revenue, declined 9% year over year. With continued pressure to customer discretionary spending and our more selective approach to new deals, our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was 0.77 with a trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio of 0.88, declining modestly from last quarter. Adjusted EBIT margin expanded 40 basis points year over year to 6.9%. This better-than-anticipated performance was largely due to top-line results ahead of our expectations. Gross margin for the first quarter was 21.9%, expanding 80 basis points year over year, largely driven by disciplined cost management within GIS. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 9.1%, flat year over year, largely due to prudent spending management. Non-GAAP net income attributable to DXC shareholders was $2 million year over year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.74, up 17% from $0.63 in the first quarter of last year. The $0.11 increase was primarily related to the benefit from lower outstanding shares. Free cash flow for the quarter was $45 million. Now, turning to our segment results. For GBS, organic revenue increased 1% year over year, largely driven by mid-single-digit growth of our Insurance Software and BPS business. Profit margin declined 50 basis points year over year to 10.8%. The changes we are making to the operating model of our CES business, including the restructuring actions we are targeting, are expected to provide future margin growth. Consulting and Engineering Services declined 1% year over year on an organic basis, consistent with the trends we saw last quarter. The book-to-bill ratio of 0.88 was impacted by the ongoing short-term project pressures reflected in both our revenue and bookings for the quarter. The trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio was stable quarter over quarter at 0.96. Insurance and Horizontal BPS grew 5% year over year on an organic basis. Embedded in this performance is our core Insurance and Software business, representing approximately 75% of the total, which was up 6% organically year over year, continuing the strong momentum we saw during 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 0.65. As a reminder, bookings in this business tend to be lumpy with significant variation quarter to quarter. Moving to GIS. Revenue declined 9% year over year on an organic basis, in line with recent trends and ahead of our expectations. While resale revenues performed as expected, down 28% year over year, services revenue declined 8% helped by higher-than-anticipated in-quarter volumes. Profit margin expanded over two points to 7.3%. This performance was largely driven by better resource management as we embedded automation in our delivery processes and take disciplined cost actions to optimize our data centers and networks. The lower mix of resale revenue also contributed to the year-to-year margin improvement. Within GIS, Cloud, ITO, and Security declined 8% year over year on an organic basis with resale revenue down 24%, impacting the total growth rate by about one point. The book-to-bill ratio was 0.67 primarily attributed to the ongoing challenging ITO market, coupled with our disciplined approach to new deals. The trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio equaled 0.76. Modern Workplace was down 14% year over year on an organic basis with a book-to-bill ratio of 0.80 and trailing 12-month ratio of 0.92, consistent with last quarter. Turning to our cash flows and balance sheet. During the quarter, our free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capex, equaled $45 million compared to a use of $75 million in the same period last year. This improvement was primarily driven by a stronger working capital position as we saw a sequential improvement in our DSO and as well as lower capex spending. Capital expenditures equaled $193 million, down $9 million year over year, and new lease originations were $7 million, down $37 million from last year. Taken together, cap expenditures and lease originations declined $46 million year over year and as a percent of revenue improved to 6.2% compared to 7.1% for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. We began to execute upon the incremental $250 million of restructuring initiatives we announced last quarter. While we saw a minimal impact to our cash flow in the first quarter, we expect the program will ramp throughout the year with the majority of spending being back-half loaded. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and cash equivalents totaling $1.3 billion. As planned, we incurred a modest increase to our debt levels to $4.1 billion due to first-quarter seasonal needs. With our cash flow generation and existing cash balances, we have ample flexibility to execute on our capital allocation plan and invest in our business. As a reminder, our capital allocation plans for the year prioritize $250 million of incremental restructuring as well as reducing our debt levels, which includes minimizing new financial lease originations that equaled $185 million during fiscal year 2024. Now, let me provide you with our latest thinking on our full-year outlook. We continue to expect total revenue to decline between 6% to 4% year over year on an organic basis. With a better-than-expected start to the year, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our full-year revenue outlook. For GBS, we are maintaining our full-year outlook calling for slightly positive top-line growth. We now expect first-half revenues to be roughly flat year over year, improving to low single-digit growth in the second half given our pipeline and stable conversion rates. We continue to anticipate GIS full-year top line to decline at low double-digit rates given expected lower resale revenues and deal selectivity. Based on first quarter performance and with our updated view of projected cost savings initiatives, we now expect full-year adjusted EBIT margin to be in the range of 6.5% to 7% compared to our prior outlook of 6% to 7%. We now expect a full-year non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 32% compared to our prior expectation of approximately 30%. This increase is largely due to an updated mix of jurisdictional income. Full-year non-GAAP diluted EPS is now anticipated to be between $2.75 and $3 compared to our prior outlook of $2.50 to $3. This update is driven primarily by the increase of our adjusted EBIT margin outlook. Free cash flow for the year is now expected to be approximately $450 million, an increase from our prior view of around $400 million. This improved outlook is largely due to the increase of our adjusted EBIT outlook as well as better working capital performance for the year. We still expect the increased level of restructuring year over year to be about $250 million skewed to the second half of the year. As a reminder, our year-over-year free cash flow expectation is largely driven by the incremental $250 million restructuring program as well as our efforts to minimize new financial lease originations that expect to lead to higher levels of capital expenditures compared to fiscal 2024. Absent these elements, our free cash flow for fiscal 2025 would be more in line with last year's performance. And now for the second quarter, we expect total organic revenue to decline 6.5% to 5.5% year over year. This decline from the Q1 growth rate is based on our backlog and the projected view of current contract volume activity. We anticipate adjusted EBIT margins in the range of 6.5% to 7% and finally, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.70 to $0.75. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Raul for some closing remarks. Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Rob. Before I turn it over for questions, I would like to briefly comment on the recent speculative reporting in the press. It is our policy not to comment on market rumors, and we do not intend to break from that policy today. As we have been discussing, we are 100% focused on building a great company by executing against our enhanced operating model that highlights our differentiated global industry-focused offering and aligns our sales and account organization by geographic markets. Our commitment will help drive more business outcomes and deliver significant value for our customers. I remain confident we will see continued progress of our efforts in our results during the coming quarters. And we'll now turn it over for your questions. Thank you. Operator All right. Thank you so much. [Operator instructions] I'll give it just one moment to compile the roster. Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Hey, thanks a lot. Good quarter here. I'll ask on the revenue with that coming in ahead of expectations. Can you give a little more detail on where the sources of upside came from? And was there any pull forward? Because this look like revenue does assume some deterioration here in the fiscal second quarter, so anything you can share would be terrific. Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Tien-Tsin, it's Rob. Thanks for the question. The strength came primarily in our ITO -- versus expectation came primarily in our ITO business, and it really came from in-quarter volume activity in our client base. And that increase in volume activity was fairly widespread, so it didn't come from a concentrated short list of customers. So, that's what really drove the outperformance relative to our original guidance. Now, we haven't factored an increased activity in the second quarter in our outlook. So, when you come to 1Q to 2Q comparisons, that increase, we're not counting on a repeat of that increase in the second quarter. Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Got it. No, I think that's prudent. My follow-up then, if you don't mind, just the disciplined approach to new deals. I know that you talked about that for a little bit. I'm just curious, the discipline here, I'm sure it's more than just price. Is there a need to then lower your delivery cost in order to be able to be more available to attack some of these deals? I know there's a talk, I think, Raul, you mentioned optimizing the global delivery network. I'm just curious if those are all related. Thank you. Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Look, I think at a macro level, the headline is a relentless focus on all aspects of execution. And that starts with existing customers because I think one of the things that I've continued to appreciate more and more as I spend more and more time with customers that have been with us five, 10, 15, 20 years-plus is that we have an incredible beachhead. Our work is valued, our professionals are very valued, and that is a great base to build off of. So, when you think about what we've been doing over the last quarter, it's been focusing on all aspects of execution from existing customers and getting those renewals and having line of sight on those renewals and making sure the economics of those renewals are good for both sides, and that's both pricing as well as cost. It's also a focus on net new deals, new logos. The number of new logos in the pipeline is at a level that I hadn't seen before. The pipeline is growing very nicely. So, the focus on execution from pre-solutioning to sales, to delivery, to the client management, you can weave in updated compensation metrics, as I mentioned in my first few calls, it's a lot of little things that are basic that weren't being done at the right level, and we're beginning to take them up to the right level. We are not done. There's a lot more work ahead, but the good news is that we're seeing early results and early returns on it. Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Good. Now, that's encouraging. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Please go ahead. Zach Ajzenman -- TD Cowen -- Analyst Thanks. This is Zach Ajzenman on for Bryan. Maybe just picking up on that last point, Raul, the early self-help focus areas that you've put into play here, can you maybe just update us on some of the near-term initiatives that the company has prioritized? And where have you seen the most progression to date? And where do you continue to see more room for improvement? Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, room for improvement, everywhere. We're nowhere near getting through the punch list of kind of operational, I won't even call it, excellence. I'd call it getting to a level of operational discipline and execution that's commensurate with a good company. And so, it's a lot of small initiatives but with the follow-up and the accountability that just wasn't there in the past and it's here now, both with our existing team that was here plus the new teammates that we've brought in. But it really is balanced. It's existing delivery, existing global delivery networks, and locations where we are servicing existing clients, where we're investing to bring in new talent. The mix of talent, we talked a little bit about having, are obviously technology talent, which is very appreciated, but also having a better fit or a better combination with industry knowledge. We have really deep industry expertise in various areas, and our Consulting and Engineering Group is continuing to build up those capabilities. And then frankly, just to step back a second, I talked a lot about storytelling on the first few calls in marketing. We've got a world-class head of marketing that we recruited who has been here a couple of months but having a huge impact. So, it really is across the board, taking it up a level in terms of just operational execution. And again, early results are good but there's still a long way to go across all those areas. Zach Ajzenman -- TD Cowen -- Analyst Got it. And on that Consulting and Engineering piece within GBS, what can you say about what you're seeing more recently in terms of stabilization? Or is there's still some further deterioration at play here? And then within that, any noteworthy vertical or geo call-out in either direction? Just kind of curious what will give clients the confidence to begin releasing spend that has been delayed and deferred in that area within services. Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Look, I think it differs vertical by vertical, industry group by industry group. For us, from a business execution, our ability to, as you said, self-help and get better with everything that we've got in front of us is going to have a bigger impact than the overall environment. The overall environment obviously affects us all, but we have so much upside based on the relentless focus on getting better at execution, in all aspects of execution, that is a much bigger factor by multiples than the spend environment. I think the spend environment, again, from my checking in with customers and hearing other companies and their comments, and talking to other CEOs, I think it's as you heard, right, it's tepid. But we do have some early signs that some of our areas where we have, again, invested in are beginning to show uptick above and beyond where the market is. Let me turn it over to Rob. Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Zach. So, there's a couple of green shoots. We're undergoing a pretty significant operating model enhancement in our CES business. And as Raul described in his opening remarks, we're focused on establishing practices and industry verticals. So, we've invested in resources in CES to help drive this change in the marketplace. And that's the primary reason the margins declined a little bit year to year in the first quarter for GBS. But as we progress and organize around these verticals, we're shifting from custom applications, which is two-thirds of that business, to enterprise applications in those specific industry verticals. And so, in those new practice areas, we're beginning to see green shoots in terms of pipeline growth; and in terms of revenue growth, in the first quarter, in certain areas like data and AI and SAP and other custom applications, other enterprise applications rather, than Howard's team is focusing on. It's early days but we are seeing benefits starting to accrue. Zach Ajzenman -- TD Cowen -- Analyst Thanks for all the color. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Jamie Friedman -- Analyst Hi. I was hoping to get some perspective specifically on the GIS margin. It's up 210 basis points year over year. And I'm wondering, Raul, how you're prioritizing margin expansion full stop relative to revenue growth or relative to anything. Is that the North Star of this? And do you have any perspective on, and some of your competitors disclosed this, the margin on renewal or on new signings? How much of the margin expansion this year is due to leaving contracts that are losing money? Any inputs that you can unpack on the GIS margin would be helpful. Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Look, it is holistic. There isn't one magic lever that you can pull on this front. It is, first of all, doing an analysis for your existing installed base and your renewals, where you're at, at the gross and net level, are the utilization numbers correct, is the labor mix correct, and then looking at other third-party costs like software pass-throughs, etc. But then it's being smart about how you're pricing both the renewal and how you're pricing net new work to factor your offering, your value-add, etc. So, it's not one lever that I can point to. I think by each business unit, and Rob will give a little bit more color commentary, they have taken a bottoms-up approach to looking at their business, looking at their customers, looking at their profitability, looking at their mix of talent. And by deal, by customer, by net new opportunity, they're making smart business decisions and pricing things and then competing effectively to be able to show the differentiated value that we bring to the table. So, it is holistic from not just numeric and spreadsheet but also are we telling the story correctly so that we can get the value that we're actually delivering. And again, early returns are that it's beginning to get better across the board in the complete life cycle. Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Yeah. And so, Jamie, it's Rob. I'll just add that the team has done a very nice job of driving automation into the accounts so they're becoming more labor efficient, if you will. And that is a sustainable change I think we'll continue to see driven down real estate costs, networking costs, so very good job on cost management. On your point on are the margins getting any better in new deals, I have seen an improvement in signed margins. But I will say the bulk of that, the important thing is delivering to those margins. So, a maniacal focus on executing the automation plays that we have, we've already started enabling. Focus on driving down the fixed cost structure is paramount and delivering with quality and not incurring SLA penalties. I have to say the team is at an all-time low in terms of delivery SLA penalties, which means they're meeting customer commitments at amazingly high rates. So, they're delivering with quality, improving costs, driving automation. All of the above led to the two points in the first quarter. So, the trend is positive. Jamie Friedman -- Analyst And for my follow-up, Rob, sorry if I missed it, but are you guiding margins at a segment level for the year? At least if you could share a trajectory, that would be helpful. Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer No, we haven't guided margins at a segment level, but I think we'll see stability in margins in both GBS and GIS. Jamie Friedman -- Analyst OK. I'll drop back. Thank you. Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg -- Analyst Hey, thank you, guys. Just wanted to come back on the book-to-bill. I know you talked about the soft discretionary spending environment, and I think it's good to see you're being more selective on some of the large deals that are out there. But can you give us a sense on how you're thinking about you're book-to-bill evolving as you go through the fiscal year? We know it can be lumpy in any given quarter, but -- Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. You cut out a little bit, but I think the question is color commentary on book-to-bill. Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Yes. So, Jason, let me -- Jason Kupferberg -- Analyst Yeah, sorry. Just forward-looking on book-to-bill, how you're thinking about it. Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, let me just take that in two parts, cover GBS and then GIS. In GBS, our book-to-bill in the first quarter was down low single digits, low to mid-single digits, and that's really a reflection of the CES market, right? And the book-to-bill of the trailing 12 months is consistent. We had all of that factored into our revenue forecast, so that was in line with expectations and our outlooks. And as Raul mentioned earlier, our pipelines are improving, and our conversion rates are stable. So, I would expect to see, really in that business, in CES, it will really depend on the marketplace. So, we're not counting on extraordinarily higher conversion rates. We're not counting on an outsized improvement in bookings. We have stability, we're counting on stability, and the pipeline supports that in GBS. In GIS, GIS has larger deals in both Modern Workplace and ITO. And there, we had a more significant year-to-year decline. It was around 30% in larger deals that occur typically in those business units. There, again, the pipelines are improving so that is very encouraging. The deals are lumpy in nature so it's hard to predict with certainty within a quarter what the bookings will be. I will say though, based on the pipeline, based on the named list of opportunities we have, we do expect bookings improvements through the rest of the year. Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And just to reiterate, it really does start with the quality of the pipeline for net new business and the quality of the renewal pursuit. And in both cases, I've been involved in multiple very, very large pursuits, where the teams are really operating again at a new level. And so, I'm encouraged that all those factors will lead to, over a 12-month period, a very, very solid book-to-bill number. As you know, in my mind, there's book-to-bill that burns in the next 12 months and book-to-bill that burns beyond that. And I think that's a distinction that I've gotten better insight in. But I'm confident that the pipeline and our existing customers will lead to a good full year on that. Jason Kupferberg -- Analyst OK. No, that's good color. And then I wanted to just come back on the new go-to-market strategy and the operating model. I mean, what's your general sense, Raul, of how long you think it will take to fully implement that across the organization? Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Look, I think I mentioned earlier that it's a full-year journey because you're putting in new processes, you're making sure those processes are followed. You're taking any sort of action if they're not being followed. But in many cases, you've got to have a couple of quarters' worth of execution to get it kind of fully right at least at an initial stage. So, I expect to see continued improvement across all these metrics for all the businesses quarter over quarter. Again, it's not one lever that is going to give you a stairstep. It's steady progress across all aspects that'll continue to deliver the results that we are beginning to see today. Jason Kupferberg -- Analyst All right. Good stuff. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Lee from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Jonathan Lee -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking our questions. It's tremendous to hear the push toward a more effective sales team. Are there any signs of or early signs of success from clients there given some of the changes you've made in the business so far? Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think the number of new logos that have won, with these, you've got to get permission to talk about them, so hopefully, we get more permission to talk about them more detail in the next call. I think the early signs are, at least for me, in looking at the business in detail, a lot more new logo wins than what we had traditionally, a lot better positioning on the resale, a lot better planning on the -- not resell, on the renewal, a lot better planning many, many quarters out on renewal, making sure that we're going into the renewal period in the strongest possible fashion, and then a lot of learnings. We're looking at deals that we lose and deals that we win and why. And I think for me, it's been really encouraging because, on the ones that I've gotten deep on that we've lost, it's been a lot of errors that we committed that we can fix. So, it wasn't that we didn't have the talent. It wasn't that we didn't have the credentials. It was some other part of the sales process and capture. And it's been great to go back and look at the wins and losses to really fine-tune how we can continue to get better on it. So, I'm very encouraged. Jonathan Lee -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst Appreciate your insight there. As a follow-up, it's good to see the project discipline you're showing. How would you characterize the current pricing environment across both GIS and GBS? And how has that evolved relative to earlier this year? Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer It's Rob, Jonathan. I mean, from my perspective and the data we have, the pricing has been stable. So, I haven't seen any notable changes up or down in the pricing environment. So, I would just characterize it as stable. Jonathan Lee -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst Thanks for the detail there. Operator [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity. Please go ahead. Rod Bourgeois -- DeepDive Equity Research -- Analyst Hey, guys. I want to first ask about investment plans. DXC has leaned into share buybacks over the past couple of years and reduced the share count. You're also working to improve free cash flow. So, I want to ask, are you feeling that you currently have sufficient capacity to invest to be competitive in your key markets while also doing the buybacks and the free cash flow improvement? So essentially, do you have room to invest? And how much and where are you making investments in your future growth? Thanks. Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer So, one of the themes that I talked about early on was that, as I came in off the board and got deep, there was a lot more to do on integration, de-duplication of back-office functions, de-duplication of legal entities, etc. So, we are going on a very thorough and consistent plan to just operate better in a more streamlined way, taking a look at things that weren't looked at before. That's providing us the ability to reinvest some of that back into the business, back into talent, back into training, back into differentiation at an industry level, and then back into innovation, the innovation around generative AI, innovation around helping our customers get their data ready to begin to use generative AI. I think there's obviously been a lot of talk and a lot of hype around that, which is correct. But I think one of the things that hasn't really been discussed is all of the process that currently is in place to do what companies do. The data and the cleanup of the data before you can actually begin to apply some of these generative AI tools, all that is going to fuel business for companies like ours and others in the industry. So, we're very well positioned to capture that. And as you know, we've got a mix of business with our customers. Many customers, we help run their operations, so we're very well-positioned to look at their internal data and be a great partner and a great leader for them in the gen AI space. But I think that across the board, with regards to your question on go-to-market, do you want to make some comments there on some investments? Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Rod. So, with the geographic market organization that we're establishing, we are investing in the markets. And as Raul mentioned, now with gen AI, we're investing in the CES practices that Howard is standing up. So, those are two areas in particular that we're investing in. And our cash generation is very stable, our balance sheet is strong, so we have ample flexibility to invest as we see fit in the business. Rod Bourgeois -- DeepDive Equity Research -- Analyst OK. Great. And it's encouraging on the bookings outlook, it sounds like, the operating model. Makes sense that it takes a while to get the traction but it's encouraging in the outlook for the second half. My question on the operating model is really a clarification one. Last year, the prior leadership was pivoting to an operating model that it called offering-led operating model. And this year, you've been emphasizing this geography-oriented sales model. So, I just wanted to clarify, maybe give us a little more color on the geography-oriented sales model and how it's different and, I assume, how you feel like it's better than the operating model that was being pursued last year. Can you just juxtapose the current operating model with the prior one that was being pursued? Thanks. Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think at a macro level, at a theme level, it's tighter and better coordination and collaboration, right? You've got the resources that are located in a geography, and you've got offerings and you've got other technical skills that may span across the company and can be leveraged across the company and across the globe. So, it, what I would say, is a better coordination of the two. I don't think it's one or the other. It is the fact that we've got talent in different parts of the world. We have better tools now to manage that talent, to find that talent, to find the availability of that talent as they come off projects and they're available to roll on to new projects. So, I would call it closer collaboration between the offerings and the geographies as kind of like what's different and why it's having a better impact now than before. Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Yeah. And Rod, just to supplement that, sales is local, right? The relationships are local, and so that's best managed in the market. So, that is one fundamental shift here is having the market presence that was missing before. And then on the flip side of that, it's invest in developing offerings once, develop global pools of skills. So, development, solutioning, delivery is a business unit core competency, and sales is local. So, that, in a nutshell, is what we're trying to accomplish with the new model. Rod Bourgeois -- DeepDive Equity Research -- Analyst Got it. Thank you. Rob Del Bene -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Welcome. Operator Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Darrin Peller -- Analyst Hi, guys. Thanks. Just in terms of developing expertise in industry verticals for the Consulting and Engineering businesses, just help us understand where there's still room to improve and just what areas do you think you need to invest in further around that. Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Tightening up solutions within an industry where there's some level of replicability, and that could be replicable frameworks in terms of how we walk the customer through getting the right solution defined and then replicable code bases in terms of how we build once but use often and take that IP with us and continue to invest in it on an industrywide basis. So, I think from what's left ahead of us in terms of improvement, I'd say that we've got that mix today, but that mix can be stronger and have a much bigger impact. The other area that I've touched on in previous calls is internal collaboration and internal communication. We have a lot of upside in being better internally, collaborating, sharing case studies, sharing technical solutions, taking things that are truly innovative that are being done, and they're all around the world, and exposing them, putting a spotlight on them, and making sure that everyone is aware of them. Every time that I go into a customer, I obviously know what we're doing for that customer. And I always take the opportunity to say, \"And did you know that we also do this?\" And so far, 100% of the time, they've come back, and they've said, \"No, I didn't know that you also do that. Can you send somebody in to help me figure out if you're a partner for us there?\" So, that internal collaboration and that internal cross-selling, there's a lot of upside there that we are just beginning to scratch the surface on. And again, when you think about all the stuff, it just goes back to basic execution at a different level. So, I'm excited about the runway that we've got there. And I'm excited about, again, the installed base and the ability to be able to tag in different parts of our business into great accounts. Darrin Peller -- Analyst Can I just ask one quick follow-up? It's just to make sure we're understanding the booking dynamics. And I understand you talked about macro volatility in GBS and timing -- I'm sorry, and timing on GIS. But I guess the shift from what was almost 100% bookings to book-to-bill last quarter in GBS, down to like -- I think it was 0.8 or so, 0.83. It just seems like a quick move. And so, I'm curious if there's anything substantial you're seeing in one particular category or some confidence you can really work on that getting a little bit better beyond just macro, anything you can do that's in your control. Thanks, guys. Raul Fernandez -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. It goes back to the quality of the pipeline as the new team has come in, scorecard of existing bids and wins and losses being better. So, I think it's both the funnel, right, how big and how qualified and how good those opportunities are, our ability to address them in a more competitive way, both clarity of the technical solution as well as pricing. And as I said, I've been working on multiple deals that are very, very, very big and the team has competed really well. And you can't talk about them until they're signed, but I'm very encouraged that starting with the funnel and then starting with better execution of opportunities that are in the funnel, that that number will, on a full year basis, be in a good place. And don't forget, like some of these deals in parts of our business can be five-year deals, right? So, the book-to-bill, because it can be multiyear like that and because it can be so big, the clarity on the next 12 months really is you need more than one quarter to really look at it. So, that's why I'm confident that we're in a good place there. Roger Sachs -- Vice President, Investor Relations Yeah. And Darrin, it's Roger. And you might recall in Raul's prepared remarks, he did mention a good part of the pipeline expansion was due to inflows in the CES business. So, it's in the right direction from an opportunity standpoint. Darrin Peller -- Analyst Understood. That makes sense, guys. Thank you. Operator All right. And at this time, we have no more questions in the queue, so I'll turn it back over to Roger Sachs and the team. Roger Sachs -- Vice President, Investor Relations Great. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

Weave Communications, Inc. stock traders use a variety of tools to make a prediction on which way the WEAV market is likely to head next. These tools can roughly be divided into indicators and chart patterns. When trying to make a Weave Communications, Inc. stock forecast, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall. Moving averages are among the most popular Weave Communications, Inc. stock prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for WEAV stock over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for WEAV is a sum of WEAV\u2019s closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12. In addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action. 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the stock market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the Weave Communications, Inc. stock price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for Weave Communications, Inc. stock. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually interpreted as a negative forecast for the WEAV market. Traders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the Weave Communications, Inc. stock price. When making a Weave Communications, Inc. stock forecast, most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of Weave Communications, Inc. stock with different granularity \u2013 for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremely short-term price action or choose a weekly candlestick chart to identify long-terms trends. 1-hour, 4-hour and 1-day candlestick charts are among the most popular. Let\u2019s use a 1-hour candlestick chart as an example of how this type of price chart gives us information about opening and closing prices. The chart is divided into \u201ccandles\u201d that give us information about Weave Communications, Inc.\u2019s stock price action in 1-hour chunks. Each candlestick will display WEAV\u2019s opening price, closing price, as well as the highest and lowest prices that Weave Communications, Inc. reached within the 1-hour period. This information makes it easier to make an informed price prediction. It\u2019s also important to pay attention to the color of the candle \u2013 a green candle means that the closing price was higher than the opening price, while a red candle tells us the opposite. Some charts will use hollow and filled candlestick bodies instead of colors to represent the same thing. Just like with any other asset, the price action of Weave Communications, Inc. stock is driven by supply and demand. These dynamics can be influenced by fundamental factors, such as earnings announcements, new product launches, acquisitions and mergers, and other factors. The WEAV stock price can also be influenced by market sentiment, broader economic conditions, interest rates, inflation rates and political developments. Some traders try to identify candlestick patterns when making stock price predictions to try and get an edge over the competition. Some candlestick formations are seen as likely to forecast bullish price action, while others are seen as bearish.

        "Extracted Text": "TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Unit Corporation (NYSE - UNT) today reported its financial and operational results for the first quarter 2018. First quarter results and recent highlights include: FIRST QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS Unit recorded net income of $7.9 million for the quarter, or $0.15 per diluted share, compared to net income of $15.9 million, or $0.31 per share, for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income (which excludes the effect of non-cash commodity derivatives) for the quarter was $11.1 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, as compared to $0.15 per diluted share for the same quarter for 2017, a 40% increase (see Non-GAAP financial measures below). Total revenues for the quarter were $205.1 million (50% oil and natural gas, 23% contract drilling, and 27% midstream), compared to $175.7 million (50% oil and natural gas, 21% contract drilling, and 29% midstream) for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $89.1 million, or $1.71 per diluted share (see Non-GAAP financial measures below). MIDSTREAM TRANSACTION On April 3, 2018, Unit closed the sale of fifty percent (50%) interest in its wholly owned midstream subsidiary, Superior, to SP Investor Holdings, LLC, which is jointly owned by OPTrust and funds managed and/or advised by Partners Group, a global private markets investment manager. The cash proceeds at closing were $300 million. Proceeds from the sale were used to pay down the outstanding amount under the company's credit agreement. The balance will be used to accelerate the drilling program of Unit\u2019s upstream subsidiary, make additional capital investments in the now jointly owned midstream subsidiary, and for general corporate purposes. Larry Pinkston, Unit\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and President, said: \u201cOur goal has been to grow the cash flow of our midstream segment to maximize the segment\u2019s value. With the association of our new partners, we believe we are now in a better position to accelerate the realization of that goal. Unit will continue to serve as managing partner of the segment and continue to reap a portion of the synergies from having Superior as part of our corporate economics. The transaction also highlighted the current value of Superior. The sale was also beneficial to Unit in other ways. We were able to pay the entire outstanding balance on our bank credit facility, which, following our most recent redetermination, now provides for a $425 million borrowing base, all of which is available for future use, if needed. The available amount of our borrowing base, coupled with the cash on hand, positions Unit with the liquidity necessary to carry out its focus on growing all of its segments. We intend to accelerate the growth within our oil and natural gas segment by adding another drilling rig later this year to its well drilling program. But in doing so, consistent with our practice, we will be deliberate with our capital spending, focusing on maximizing the value received for the capital expended.\u201d TERMINATION OF AT-THE-MARKET COMMON STOCK PROGRAM Because of the liquidity created by the Superior transaction, Unit has elected to terminate the At-The-Market Common Stock Program initiated in February 2017. Under that program, the company could offer and sell, occasionally, shares of its common stock up to an aggregate offering price of $100.0 million. To date under the program, Unit sold 787,547 shares of its common stock resulting in proceeds of approximately $18.6 million. OIL AND NATURAL GAS SEGMENT INFORMATION For the quarter, per day equivalent production was 46.5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBoe), a decrease of less than 1% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) production represented 46% of total equivalent production. Oil production was 8,178 barrels per day, an increase of 4% over the fourth quarter of 2017. NGLs production was 13,275 barrels per day, a decrease of 3% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Natural gas production was 150 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day, a decrease of 1% from the fourth quarter of 2017. The slight decrease in daily production from fourth quarter 2017 to first quarter 2018 was due to the timing of completions on a multi-well pad in the Texas Panhandle and a two-week delay in drilling operations in the Gulf Coast area. Unit\u2019s average realized per barrel equivalent price for the quarter was $24.18, a 4% increase over the fourth quarter of 2017. Unit\u2019s average natural gas price was $2.62 per Mcf, an increase of 10% over the fourth quarter of 2017. Unit\u2019s average oil price was $55.10 per barrel, an increase of 1% over the fourth quarter of 2017. Unit\u2019s average NGLs price was $21.08 per barrel, a decrease of 4% from the fourth quarter of 2017. All prices in this paragraph include the effects of derivative contracts. In the Wilcox area, Unit continued its exploration and recompletion programs during the quarter. In the Wing prospect area, the Wing #18 was drilled and completed in the BP Fee \"C\" sand, resulting in a successful discovery of a new pay interval. Unit is currently drilling the Wing #20 to further delineate this discovery. Unit's first exploration well in the Cherry Creek prospect area, the Trinity #1 well, has continued to perform well, and the company will drill its first Cherry Creek delineation well later in the second quarter. Also, eight recompletions and two workover wells were completed throughout the Wilcox play during the quarter. In the Buffalo Wallow area of the Granite Wash, Unit continued its \"C1\" zone development efforts. The Francis three-well pad was drilled and completed and started first sales in February. The wells continue to clean up and are expected to meet or exceed the \"C1\" type curve. The Carr three-well pad was drilled and completed in late March and the wells are in the early flowback stages. Unit will possibly add an additional rig later this year. In the Southern Oklahoma Hoxbar Oil Trend (SOHOT) area, during the quarter, Unit completed three new Marchand horizontal wells, the Schenk Trust #1-17HXL, with an IP30 of 2,318 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day, the McConnell #1-11H with an IP30 of 1,426 Boe per day, and the Livingston Land #1-33/4, which is in the early stages of clean up. Unit\u2019s plan is to continue running one rig throughout the remainder of the year. In western Oklahoma, Unit spud its initial well in the STACK play, the Irwin #1-4H, in Dewey County, Oklahoma during March and also participated in seven non-operated wells during the first quarter. Pinkston said: \u201cOur oil and natural gas segment placed its third drilling rig into service in mid-January and its fourth rig into service during March. Our focus on drilling and completing multi-well pads results in an uneven production growth profile. Our well results continue to meet or exceed expectations. Our production guidance remains unchanged, with 2018 production anticipated to grow to 17.1 to 17.4 MMBoe, or 7% to 9% year over year from 2017. During the quarter, we sold non-core oil and natural gas assets, net of related expenses, for $21.7 million.\" This table illustrates certain comparative production, realized prices, and operating profit for the periods indicated: Mar 31, 2018 Mar 31, 2017 Mar 31, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 CONTRACT DRILLING SEGMENT INFORMATION Unit's average number of drilling rigs working during the quarter was 31.7, an increase of 2% over the fourth quarter of 2017. Per day drilling rig rates averaged $17,038, a 2% increase over the fourth quarter of 2017. Average per day operating margin for the quarter was $5,179 (before elimination of intercompany drilling rig profit of $0.4 million). This margin compares to first quarter 2017 average operating margin of $3,474 (before elimination of intercompany drilling rig profit of $0.6 million), an increase of 49%, or $1,705. Pinkston said: \u201cOur contract drilling segment continues to show solid results. The BOSS rig continues to set new performance records for several operators. We were able to negotiate a new long-term contract for our 11th BOSS rig, which is under construction. All 10 of our BOSS rigs are under contract, and we currently have a total of 32 drilling rigs operating. Long-term contracts (contracts with original terms ranging from six months to two years in length) are in place for six of our drilling rigs. Of the six contracts, one is up for renewal in the second quarter of 2018, two in the third quarter, two in the fourth quarter and one in 2019.\u201d This table illustrates certain comparative results for the periods indicated: Mar 31, 2018 Mar 31, 2017 Mar 31, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 )% MIDSTREAM SEGMENT INFORMATION For the quarter, gas processed volumes per day increased 2%, while gas gathered and liquids sold volumes per day decreased 3% and 1%, respectively, from the fourth quarter of 2017.

This table illustrates certain comparative results for the periods indicated: Mar 31, 2018 Mar 31, 2017 Mar 31, 2018 Pinkston said: \u201cGas processing volumes continued to improve due to increased throughput from third-party operators primarily at our Bellmon and Cashion plants. With our new partners, we are actively seeking opportunities to accelerate growth in this segment.\u201d FINANCIAL INFORMATION Unit ended the quarter with long-term debt of $790.5 million, comprised of $642.8 million of senior subordinated notes (net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs) and $147.7 million of borrowings under the company's credit agreement.

        "Extracted Text": "HAUPPAUGE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Vicon Industries, Inc. (NYSE MKT:VII), a global producer of end-to-end security solutions, today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended March 31, 2016. Eric Fullerton, Vicon\u2019s CEO said, \u201cThe Company\u2019s financial results for the quarter were very disappointing and included a $6 million write off of goodwill originating from the August 2014 IQinVision business combination. Revenues declined 22% to $8.0 million for this historically weak quarter as the Company experienced issues with certain of its camera product lines and a delay in receipt of certain key project orders. Although we have taken steps to correct these issues, their impact may linger through the balance of this fiscal year. Based upon these results, the Company implemented a cost restructuring plan that will phase in material operating cost reductions over the remaining two quarters of fiscal 2016. This measure is also intended to refocus our resources on our more strategic initiatives. In the quarter, the Company also sold its United Kingdom based operating facility, generating $1.5 million of net cash proceeds and secured a $3 million asset based credit facility to address its near term working capital needs.\u201d \u201cSince 2012, we have made a significant investment in the development of a completely new and strategically critical video management system (VMS). The funding of this major development effort has contributed to the Company\u2019s ongoing operating losses and depletion of cash reserves. The first release of this new product is scheduled for October 2016 and is ultimately expected to significantly enhance the Company\u2019s market competitiveness across broader market channels. We are very excited about the prospects of launching this new product offering after many years of development effort. The ease-of-use, functionality and openness of this new software platform should be well received by the market. In the meantime, we will continue to maintain our focus on ongoing market challenges and execution of other key strategic initiatives.\u201d Second Quarter Fiscal 2016 Financial Results Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 decreased 22% to $8.0 million as compared to $10.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. The $2.3 million decrease in the current quarter included a $1.3 million, or 17%, decrease in sales in the Americas market and a $1.0 million, or 36%, decrease in EMEA market sales. The Americas market was negatively impacted by certain camera line production issues and the EMEA market experienced a delay in receipt of certain expected orders that were fulfilled in the subsequent quarter. Order intake for the current quarter decreased $4.3 million to $7.3 million as compared to $11.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Gross profit margins for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 decreased to 33.0% as compared to 38.0% in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Principal factors contributing to the margin decrease were the recognition of $150,000 (1.9%) of additional inventory provisions relating to the rework and transition of the Company's IQinVision camera line to a new contract manufacturing partner and the impact of predominantly fixed indirect production costs on lower sales (1.6%). Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 increased $5.5 million to $11.1 million compared with $5.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. In the current quarter, the Company charged off its entire $6.0 million goodwill carrying value originating from the August 2014 IQinVision business combination. This noncash charge was principally based upon an updated assessment of the Company's continuing depressed market valuation and operating losses. The prior year quarter included $224,000 of severance charges in connection with a merger related integration and restructuring plan. Excluding the effects of the current quarter goodwill writeoff and the prior year quarter severance charges, operating expenses decreased $244,000 in the current quarter. The Company recorded a gain on the sale of its United Kingdom based operating facility of $785,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was $7.7 million, or $.82 per basic and diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $1.8 million, or $.19 per basic and diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Adjusted non-GAAP net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was $2.2 million, or $.23 per basic and diluted share, as compared to adjusted non-GAAP net loss of $1.3 million, or $.14 per basic and diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Please refer to the presentation at the end of the table of operations for a reconciliation of our second quarter GAAP net loss to our adjusted non-GAAP net loss for such periods.

        "Extracted Text": "- Updates Full-Year Revenue Guidance and Maintains Earnings Guidance for Fiscal Year 2017 - RESTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MAXIMUS (NYSE: MMS), a leading provider of government services worldwide, today reported financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Highlights for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 include: For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, revenue increased 9% to $607.6 million compared to $556.7 million reported for the same period last year driven by the Health Services Segment. Revenue growth was partially offset by a 3% decline from unfavorable foreign currency translation. On a constant currency basis, revenue would have increased 12% compared to the same period last year. Organic revenue grew 11% and acquired growth was 1%. Total company operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was 12.1%. For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, net income attributable to MAXIMUS totaled $46.7 million, or $0.71 of diluted earnings per share, compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.40 for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase was due to improved income contributions across all segments, most notably from the Health Services and U.S. Federal Services Segments. The prior-year period was tempered by programs in start up, as well as the timing of an $8.6 million delayed change order where the costs were recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, but the associated revenue and profit were recognized at the time of contract execution in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 were better than expected due to solid performance across the portfolio. Most notably, the U.S. Federal Services Segment over-delivered by approximately $0.04. In addition, restructuring costs related to the ongoing consolidation and integration of the Company's human services operations in the U.K. were $0.02 better than previously expected. \"We are pleased with the solid results in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and the increased contributions and steady progress toward target operating margins from certain key contracts that were ramping up last fiscal year. The reduction in fiscal 2017 revenue guidance is principally due to a contract cancellation in the U.S. Federal Services Segment. However, the long-term, macro-economic drivers of rising caseloads and increasing demand for effective government programs remain unchanged. With $4.0 billion of opportunities in our reported pipeline, demand for our services remains strong and we are keenly focused on capturing new organic growth,\" commented MAXIMUS CEO Richard A. Montoni. Health Services Segment Health Services Segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 17% to $340.7 million compared to $291.9 million reported for the same period last year. Most of the growth in the quarter was organic and driven by the expansion on existing contracts, which was offset by a 5% decline from unfavorable foreign currency translation. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth would have been 21%. Operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 increased to 14.7% compared to 9.2% reported in the prior-year period. The expansion in margin was due to forecasted improvements from programs that were ramping up in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In addition, operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was also tempered by the timing of the aforementioned change order. U.S. Federal Services Segment U.S. Federal Services Segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 3% to $141.3 million compared to $145.3 million reported for the same period last year. The lower revenue was largely a result of significantly lower volumes on a large health care contract for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs where MAXIMUS is a subcontractor. MAXIMUS was recently notified that this contract has been canceled due to insufficient volumes and will now end in April 2017. Operating margin for the first quarter was 12.7% compared to 7.4% reported for the prior-year period. The margin expansion was due to better-than-projected volumes on a couple of transaction-based contracts and, to a lesser extent, savings from automation initiatives. Human Services Segment Human Services Segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 5% to $125.5 million compared to $119.5 million for the same period last year. Most of the growth in the quarter was organic and driven by increased revenue from operations in Australia, which offset expected decreased revenue from the wind down of the Work Programme in the United Kingdom. The segment was unfavorably impacted by a 2% decline in foreign currency translation. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth would have been 7%. Operating margin for the first quarter was 9.4% compared to 7.6% for the same period last year. Operating margin improvement was due to the expected improvements in the Australia jobactive contract that was in the start-up phase in the same period last year. This operating margin excludes the $2.2 million restructuring charge in the United Kingdom. Sales and Pipeline Year-to-date signed contract awards at December 31, 2016 totaled $462.4 million. New contracts pending (awarded but unsigned) totaled $150.4 million. The sales pipeline at December 31, 2016 was $4.0 billion (comprised of approximately $1.7 billion in proposals pending, $0.2 billion in proposals in preparation, and $2.0 billion in opportunities tracking). This compares to a pipeline of $4.3 billion at September 30, 2016. The decline is due to contracts converting to new awards, procurement delays mostly due to the transition to the new administration in the United States, and certain contract losses. The Company\u2019s reported pipeline only reflects those opportunities where MAXIMUS expects the request for proposal to be released within the next six months. Balance Sheet and Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 totaled $69.8 million. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, cash flows from operations totaled $71.1 million, with free cash flow of $63.4 million. At December 31, 2016, Days Sales Outstanding (DSOs) were within the Company\u2019s expected range at 70, and consistent with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. On November 30, 2016, MAXIMUS paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.045 per share. On January 11, 2017, the Company announced a $0.045 per share cash dividend, payable on February 28, 2017 to shareholders of record on February 15, 2017. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, MAXIMUS repurchased approximately 559,000 shares of the Company's common stock for $28.8 million, at a weighted average price of $51.68. At December 31, 2016, MAXIMUS had an estimated $109 million available for repurchases under its Board-authorized share repurchase program. Outlook The Company is updating its fiscal 2017 revenue guidance most notably as a result of the canceled contract due to insufficient volumes in the U.S. Federal Services Segment. MAXIMUS now expects revenue to range between $2.425 billion and $2.475 billion for fiscal 2017. This compares to the Company's prior range of $2.475 billion to $2.550 billion. The Company is reiterating its earnings guidance and continues to expect GAAP diluted earnings per share to range between $2.90 and $3.10 for fiscal 2017. The Company is also reiterating its cash flow guidance and continues to expect cash flows from operations to range between $230 million and $280 million and free cash flow to range between $170 million and $220 million for fiscal 2017. The Company\u2019s guidance does not include any future acquisitions or future legal expenses or recoveries.

Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC All right. Thank you, Xinyuan. Good morning and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We concluded 2021 with strong operating and financial results. Operationally, we successfully achieved this year's delivery target by adding approximately 25,000 cabinets in the full year of 2021, including 13,276 cabinets that were delivered in the fourth quarter. Financially, for the full year of 2021, we grew our revenue by 28% and our adjusted EBITDA by 32%. We attribute our achievements to favorable government policies, robust marketing men, precision strategy execution, and methodical service expansion. First, we are pleased to see the favorable government policies continue to provide a strong tailwind to our industry development. Last month, the Eastern Data, Western Computing plan was joined and released by China's National Development and Reform Commission together with three other essential regulatory departments. Of the eight national computing hubs, we have already deployed our data centers in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Yangtze River Delta, Greater Bay Area, Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In addition, this January, the State Council of China unveiled the first five-year growth plan for the digital economy, highlighting the sector's role in reshaping global economic structure and rolling out development targets through 2025. The plan laid out measures for operating national infrastructure, bolstering the role of data at the production element, and promoting digital transformation. The plan also gives priority to the development of digital infrastructure, a pillar of achieving digital economic prosperity that will also spur investment and drive overall economic growth. During the fourth quarter, we received orders, not only from [Inaudible] technology companies in the internet sectors but also traditional companies in brick-and-mortar industries that are transforming through digitalization. In addition, we're seeing growing demand in both the wholesale and retail segments. In order to seize this burgeoning market demand, we maintained a laser-sharp focus on executing our dual-core strategy to offer both wholesale and retail IDC services, enabling us to achieve solid operating results. On the cabinet delivery front, we added 13,276 cabinets on a net basis in the fourth quarter to 78,540 cabinets as of December 31, 2021. Despite a myriad of challenges, including equipment delivery delays caused by the COVID resurgence in certain regions of China, global chips shortages, and construction difficulties due to excessively cold weather, to meet our annual delivery targets against all odds is a strong testament to our solid execution capabilities, developed on the foundation of our extensive experience in the IDC sectors. This achievement demonstrates our superior capabilities in project management, logistics, as well as suppliers and government relations. In addition, we successfully leveraged our extensive technological expertise to explore expansion resources. Turning to our monthly recurring revenue, our retail IDC MMR reached a new high of 9,301 in the fourth quarter, representing 2% year-over-year growth. Our continued growth in MMR is a manifestation of the increasing endorsement from our existing customers. As we continue to improve our service capabilities and enrich our one-stop solution offerings, our existing customers expanded their contract scope accordingly to include more value-added services such as interconnectivity, bare metal services, hybrid cloud services, O&M, and more. We are also making good progress on our utilization rate. Our compound utilization rate increased to 61.6% in the fourth quarter, compared to 59.8% in the previous one. This increase was mainly driven by consistently strong demand from the internet sectors and the visualization trend in the traditional industries such as financial services, automobile, manufacturing, and local services. The utilization rate for mature cabinets, which consisted of cabinet deliveries prior to and during 2019, was 76.7%, compared to 75.5% in the previous quarter. The utilization rate for ramp-up in newly built cabinets, which consisted of cabinet deliveries in 2020 and 2021, was 39.6%, compared to 34.7% in the previous quarter. That being said, we do expect to see some seasonal fluctuations in the utilization rates in the first quarter. This is because each year, we reclassify mature, ramp-up, and newly built cabinets in the first quarter, and we delivered a large amount of newly built cabinets in the fourth quarter of last year. On the resource front, we have recently secured new resources, exceeding 20 megawatts in capacity, at a premium location in Beijing, and we expect to deliver the cabinets over the next two years in multiple phases. Additionally, we continued to secure more resources in other Tier 1 cities and surrounding areas. On the wholesale business side, while maintaining our ramp-up speed, we continued to securing more orders from existing and new customers. Our customers in the internet sectors and cloud computing industry maintain a healthy pace of development and ramp up fast to meet their increasing data processing needs. In the fourth quarter, we won a pre-committed order of approximately seven megawatts in capacity from an existing internet customer. Recently, the same customer awarded us a further pre-committed order of approximately 11 megawatts in capacity. And we also secured three other orders, totaling approximately five megawatts in capacity. Two of them were multiyear contracts from our existing customers in the internet and technology sectors, respectively, while the third one was a multiyear contract with a state-owned cloud enterprise in the Southern region -- Southern Western region of China. We continue to see the increase in demand in our wholesale business and are confident of our future prospects in this segment. Turning to our retail business, the digital transformation trend further fueled our business growth across multiple verticals. We continue to see strong demand from several industries, including financial services, automobile manufacturing, local services, and IT services. In addition, we also saw increased demand from traditional industries such as logistics, manufacturing, and construction. For example, several globally renowned companies partnered with us to expand their business in China during the quarter, demonstrating our strong customer recognition, exceptional operating track record, and superior IDC technologies. These customers include a leading global investment bank, the world-leading credit rating service provider, and a global leader in the premium in luxury car industry. We have now reached over 1,400 IDC customers in total, and they operate in a wide variety of industries. This growth and diversification of our customer base will help us to mitigate any potential adverse regulatory changes and also serves as a secure foundation for the future development of our dual-core strategy. For our Blue Cloud business, we continued to grow the business by providing industry specific solutions to help our customers improve their operational efficiency and reduce costs. Witnessing the unprecedented supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to proactively develop a solution to help our clients resolve acute pains in their logistics management and shorten their product-to-market time. We recently initiated a logistics execution system, one of our key such offerings to IDC customers in the automotive industry. This SaaS offering improved support for lean manufacturing, with the aim of minimizing lead time and increasing customer satisfaction by fulfilling tailored requirements. The system also provides better warehouse management by synchronizing online and offline orders, enabling direct ordering from manufacturers, eliminates the need for intermediate distributors, allowing manufacturers to produce goods based on the actual needs of customers. During the quarter, Niutron, a new local EV manufacturer, began using our logistics execution system and provided excellent initial feedback. Utilizing our successful execution experience and product development capabilities, we expect to expand our product reach to serve more upstream and downstream industry participants in the automotive industry and expand into various other sectors going forward. Beyond the execution of our strategy, we further explore options to diversify our financing solutions and enhancing the resilience of our business. In January, we reached an agreement with Blackstone, the world's largest alternative investment firm. Pursuant to which, Blackstone made an additional investment in VNET by purchasing $250 million of our convertible notes. Last December, we signed a master joint venture investment agreement with a sovereign wealth fund. Together, we will form joint ventures to pursue development and investment opportunities in multiple build-to-suit hyperscale data center projects in China. As a leading data center service providers in the industry, we have always considered sustainable development as a core part of our mission since inception, and ESG strategy is an integral part of our long-term business success. We aim to achieve both carbon neutrality and 100% renewable energy by 2030, and we have also committed to a number of ESG initiatives. First of all, we strive to contribute to a sustainable future. We became a signatory of the U.N. Global Compact in November 2021 and now pledged to consider all 17 U.N. Sustainable Development Goals in our comprehensive business development. Similarly, in the pursuit of increasing the renewable energy ratio in our energy consumption, we successfully signed strategic cooperation agreements with China Huadian Corporation, Shanghai Electric Wind Power Group, and China Southern Power Grid Energy Efficiency and Clean Energy Co. In addition, as a response to the international initiatives and domestic callings against climate change, we're now examining climate-related risks and opportunities concerning the industry and have recently committed to supporting the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, aka TCFD. Last but not least, we continue striving to decrease the PUE of our data centers. The average PUE of our stabilized data center was 1.37 in 2021, notably lower than the industry average. Turning to our capital market initiatives, I would like to take the opportunity to share with you that we are planning a secondary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. We believe a secondary listing in Hong Kong will provide our shareholders with an additional trading venue while offering them greater protection amid an evolving regulatory environment. The timing of our contemplated secondary listing is subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals, however. In summary, 2021 was a rewarding year. We maintained consistent execution of our dual-core strategy to achieve sustained growth, and we also succeeded in meeting our annual target for 2021 by delivering approximately 25,000 cabinets. In consideration of the uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment, we would like to revise our annual cabinet delivery target from 25,000 cabinets to a range of 14,400 to 17,400 cabinets for the year of 2022. With that, I would now turn the call over to Tim. He would discuss our financial results for the quarter and his thoughts on our future growth. Hi, Tim. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Samuel. Good morning and good evening, everyone. Before we start our detailed financial discussion, please note that we will present non-GAAP measures today. Our non-GAAP results exclude certain noncash expenses, which are not part of our core operations. The details of these expenses may be found in the reconciliation tables included in our press release. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, all the financial numbers we present today are for the fourth quarter of 2021 and in renminbi terms, while percentage changes are on a year-over-year basis. As Samuel mentioned, our performance in 2021 was characterized by healthy revenue growth and margin expansion, improved operational efficiency, augmented utilization rates, and consistent cabinet capacity deliveries, which proceeded according to schedule despite macro uncertainties. Net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased to 1.75 billion, a 29.4% year-over-year increase from the fourth quarter of 2020. This increase was mainly due to increased customer demand for our highly scalable carrier and cloud-neutral IDC solutions from both wholesale and retail IDC customers, as well as the notable growth in our cloud business. Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 380 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 29.1% and a sequential increase of 1.3%. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 21.8%, compared to 21.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 24% in the third quarter of 2021. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin -- or small decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the massive delivery of new cabinets, which usually have a ramp-up phase to reach the expected profit level. Adjusted cash gross profit, which excludes depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation expenses, was 713.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 22.7% from the fourth quarter of 2020 and 5.8% from the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted cash gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 40.9%, compared to 43.2% in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and third quarter of 2021. Adjusted operating expenses, which exclude the share-based compensation expenses, compensation for post-combination employment and acquisition, impairment of loan and receivable to potential investee, and impairment of long-lived assets, were 273.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, representing an increase of 27% from the fourth quarter of 2020 and 12.2% from the third quarter of 2021. As a percentage of net revenues, adjusted operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2021 were 15.7%, compared to 16% in the same period of 2020 and 15.6% in the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 463 million, representing an increase of 18.8% year over year from the fourth quarter of 2020 and an increase of 2.8% sequentially from the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2021 excluded share-based compensation expenses of 253 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 26.5%, compared to 28% -- 28.9%, sorry, in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2021. Our net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 27.3 million, compared to a net loss of 1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, and a net profit of 156.2 million in the third quarter of 2021. Basic and diluted loss were 0.03 and 0.28 per ordinary share, respectively; and 0.18 and 1.68 per ADS, respectively. Each ADS represents six class A ordinary shares. As for our balance sheet, the aggregate amount of the company's cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments as of December 31, 2021, was 1.71 billion, a decrease of 49.8% from December 31, 2020. Meanwhile, net cash generated from operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 664 million, compared to 283.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 134.7 million in the third quarter of 2021. Our capex in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 2.2 billion, and the total capex for the full year 2021 was 4 billion. We expect to invest 4 billion to 5 billion in capex for both our data center constructions and M&A considerations for the full year of 2022. Looking forward, we will continue to explore various financing solutions, execute diligently on our dual-core growth strategy, increase our customer diversification to cultivate resilience, and further consolidate our position as a leading data center services provider in China. Now, moving to outlook, for the full year of 2022, we anticipate net revenues to be in the range of 7,450 million to 7,750 million and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 1,975 million to 2,125 million. The midpoints of the company's updated estimates imply year-over-year increases of 22.8% and 16.9% in net revenues and adjusted EBITDA, respectively. This forecast reflects the company's current and preliminary views on the market and its operational conditions and does not factor in any potential future impacts caused by the COVID pandemic and is subject to change. This concludes our prepared remarks for today. Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Operator Thank you. We would now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] This question comes from the line of Yang Liu from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Yang Liu -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thanks for the opportunity to ask questions. Two questions from my side. The first one is on the demand. We see a downward revision of the full year new capacity delivery plan for 2022. Could you please update us in terms of the wholesale and the retail fleet? And if I remember correctly, previously, 25,000 actually is 80% for wholesale and the scale retail and 20% for traditional retail business. But what is the new fleet and where do you see the downward revision of this amount? And the second is for the 2022 margin. We see the new -- the 2022 guidance for revenue growth, which is pretty strong, but the EBITDA on the growth revenue. What is the reason for that? Is it mainly because of the higher utility cost or is there any other reason behind that? Thank you. Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC OK. Tim, do you want to take the question first, and then I can chime in later? Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Absolutely. So, in terms of the demand outlook, we are looking at a roughly 60-40 split, wholesale versus retail. And so, the retail does comprise a component of the scale retail. So, actually, on the downward guide on the cabinets was actually a pro-rata guide. So, we're not necessarily saying that there's one segment versus the other segment. And then I guess in terms of the question on the EBITDA versus the revenue growth, we are, as you know, steadily ramping up the wholesale side of the engine, but we also have other business segments. And so, some of the other business segments are not EBITDA types of businesses or they have lower margins. And so, that actually is increasing the sort of cost related to those. More importantly is we also, in our guidance, have factored in the increase in utility costs. And that accounts for, let's say, around just under a 1% of the decline in margins as well. So, I think that's the main drivers, Yang, to your question. I guess, in terms of the overall demand outlook, in terms of the details, Samuel, I don't know if you wanted to add some color for Yang on the wholesale and retail demand that we've been seeing. Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC Yes, definitely. Again, thanks, Yang, for the question. I think, overall, given the favorable government policy and also the rise of data sovereignty and plus the digital transformation momentum, so, overall, we're still very bullish about our long-range outlook, in general. But we also have to understand that there is a macro issues that we have to be careful about. Industry-wise and market-wise, there's also kind of different, I would say, different climate compared to about the last year. And therefore, company-wise, we want to be a little bit cautious. You know, one thing -- on one hand, there's a business priority, on the other hand, there's a resource needs that we want to balance. So, that's the reason. Overall, business outlook, fantastic. And we're very bullish. But we're taking a cautious approach step by step. So, I think that's the additional color which I want to add on top of what Tim mentioned earlier. Thank you, Yang. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Yang, sorry, one more point on the question you had on EBITDA. I think one of the other factors that you want to take into consideration as well is the fact that we added, you know, 13,000 cabinets at the end of 2021. And so, we are also factoring a drag on the EBITDA when it will take then for these cabinets to slowly ramp up during the course of '22. So, there will be more costs, obviously, in the first part of the year until they start ramping up. And these are, you know, fixed costs with the delivery of cabinets. Yang Liu -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK, thank you. As a follow-up, in terms of the other low-margin business, is it -- the concern is for Microsoft and also the VPN growing faster or -- and also other IT service business or something else have some dragging effect on the margin? Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC I can probably comment on that one. So, first of all, again, precisely, it is not a low-margin business. I would say it's not like pure IDC wholesale play, which is EBITDA type of business. You know, cloud business or value-added services, they are not much related to EBITDA, but it is a very healthy business, again, from the gross margin point of view. But assuming you are also interested about -- to know about the Microsoft Cloud growth and also VPN growth, I think from a market perspective, the Microsoft Cloud, which basically includes the Azure, Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform, is highly welcomed in the enterprise space. And then, of course, we're benefiting from their growth by being the Microsoft's closest operating partners in China. From a number perspective, I would say, we continue enjoying the very healthy double-digit growth year over year. And then switch to the VPN that you mentioned about, which is the MPLS VPN. It is still highly regarded as one of the highest quality options for enterprise connection. But we're seeing some of the customers having a need to balance their price performance. Some of them will continue to go for MPLS VPN, and then some of them will try to go with the SD-WAN. Luckily, because we do provide both routes and options to -- for customers to choose, we're seeing the SD-WAN business pick up very, very fast, high double-digit growth year over year. So, I think combined together, it is still very healthy and great business for us. Hopefully, that answered your question, Yang. Yang Liu -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Yes. Thank you, Samuel. Operator [Operator instructions] Next question comes from the line of Edison Lee of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Edison Lee -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hi, Samuel and Tim. thank you very much for the presentation. I want to focus on your target for 2022. You take a range of 14,400 to 17,400 cabinets. I want to know how comparable this number is versus the previous guidance of 25,000 cabinets because, obviously, wholesale build-out is not based on cabinets but based on macro bought, right. So, could you maybe help us understand how we should actually look at this new guidance range versus the previous 25,000? And number two is that, at the moment, do you have any thoughts about 2023 because, previously, it was a three-year target? And how should investors think about the 2023 situation based on your understanding of demand right now? Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Let me take a crack at this, Edison. Thanks for the questions. In terms of the comparability between the cabinets provided, I would say it's on a similar basis. So, we've not changed the basis in terms of disclosing the number of cabinets. You're absolutely correct that the projects, which are wholesale based, these are higher density cabinets, and so, naturally, there are less cabinets. Now, in terms of the 2023 and looking beyond, I would sort of go back to 2020 -- end of 2020 when we provided the three-year forward look in terms of cabinets. It was at the completion of what was a extremely successful year for the industry and for us and our peers in 2020. And clearly, with a lot of the regulatory headwinds that we saw in 2021, that changed dramatically and has not fully turned around yet here as we start 2022. So, I would say and echo Samuel's earlier comments, we are extremely bullish on the sector. We're extremely bullish on the customers' requirements. And if you look at it, you know, there is no reduction in terms of the end-users like ourselves, you know, using data, storing data, analyzing data. And so, the demand is there. But again, we've taken a more cautious approach for 2022 just given the large number of uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. We also look to the market and do see slower than expected move-in rates. And so, for '22, we've guided down all of these projects to a certain extent. Some of these projects could be accelerated, so moved from a '23 timetable and moved up into '22. And similarly, you know, things -- if we see the pick up during the course of this year, then we would start the '23 projects, and therefore, that would lead to a higher number for '23. But frankly, at sort of March of '22, again, based on the outlook, I would say that '23 should be higher than '22. But whether we're, you know, going back to 25,000, again, I would take 25,000 as a end of 2020, what the market condition was at that time, and we're taking a more cautious approach given the current market conditions and probably don't want to push out a number out this early in the year for something that there isn't enough visibility on. But again, we can turn on and off the capex. And therefore, we do expect that we can be quite nimble with regards to '23. Thank you. Edison Lee -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thank you, Tim. Can I follow up on two other issues? Number one is that I think you disclosed that 16 megawatts of new wholesale projects that you signed in 1Q this year and 11 megawatts you signed in 4Q last year. Is it true that these are all from existing wholesale customers and you did not  any brand new customers in 4Q and 1Q? Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Samuel, you want to take a first crack at that? Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC Yes. Again, thank you, Edison, for the questions. For the 4Q, from a wholesale perspective, we share about seven megawatts, that was indeed from the existing customers. But something we haven't really, you know, say out loud is our scale retail. We also have big wins from scale retail customers in Q4, that was actually four megawatts in addition to their previous, you know, kind of an allocation in contract. And for the 1Q, because, yes, some of the orders come in from existing customer, but we do have the orders coming from new customers, public cloud providers, and also the e-commerce platform companies, and also of state-owned dedicated cloud, and so on and so forth. Again, we still have, you know, few more -- I would say, a few more discussions going on. And so, hopefully, probably in May time frame when we talk about our Q1 earnings release, we could share additional color for our Q1 performance. Edison Lee -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. Thank you, Samuel. So, the state-owned company, state-owned enterprise cloud service provider is a brand new customer? Is that right? Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC Yes. Edison Lee -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Sorry, just one follow up for Tim on the power costs. You said that there will be a 1-percentage-point impact. But my understanding is that all the wholesale contracts -- for all the wholesale contracts, you do not include power costs. So, that's why it is a pass-through. So, is that 1-percentage-point impact coming from retail customers because you have a one to three-year contract so that's why you have a time lag in terms of passing on power costs? Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, as of the end of '21, that is in the large majority of our billable capacity was actually bundled with power. And a big portion of that is, yes, the wholesale business is still ramping up. So, it's a very small percentage. We do expect that by the end of this year, the sort of unbundled or pass-through proportion will probably increase to, let's say, circle around 30%. And it is the ramp-up of the wholesale, which is one portion. But the second one is the extra power costs are being included in the quotation of the renewals, as well as the new retail contracts that we're signing. So, I think the answer to that is actually yes to both. It is a rollover of new contracts, but also a ramp-up of the wholesale. Edison Lee -- Jefferies -- Analyst So, for power costs, are you assuming a 20% increase year on year on -- just on the unit power cost? OK, I'm not talking about [Inaudible] Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, so -- yeah. So, overall, depending on the region, we're expecting between 10% to 20%, so full year 2021 compared to 2022. And again, that's -- the sort of impact that we're expecting is under 1% to our margins. Edison Lee -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. Thank you very much. Yeah, that's it from me. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer No, thank you. Operator Thank you for the question. Our next question comes from the line of [Inaudible] of CIBC. Please go ahead. Unknown speaker Good morning, management. My question is about the M&A plan, and you mentioned about 2022 capex plans between 4 billion and 5 billion. So, how much proportion is to be factored to be used in M&A opportunities? And do you see the price of IDC projects in the premium market show like going trend this year compared to 2020 and 2021? Thank you. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Thank you very much. Let me take this question and, Samuel, you can add if there's anything else. For the question in terms of the percentage of M&A, I would sort of look back at '21 and say that, you know, roughly 30% of 2021 related to acquisitions of land power, acquisitions of service companies, and acquisitions of actual data center assets. So, as I then look at what we've been planning out for 2022 and providing the 4 billion to 5 billion guidance, we're expecting probably in the range of 15% to 30%. It is a wider range, but that's because some of the M&A projects tend to be larger in size. And so, a swing of doing it or not doing it could actually result in a larger percentage change. Now, in answer to your question about where do we see pricing of IDC projects, I would say, you know, we're still using a guidepost in terms of what we see in a market of around 10 times EBITDA pricing. Obviously, when we do evaluate the projects, it's not purely based on the price but also on the locations in terms of proximity to our existing data centers, as well as where the customer demands are in making that evaluation. The other point I would make is that, you know, obviously, the best projects that, you know, we -- where the vast majority of our projects are self-built projects. So, you'll see a lot more greenfield-brownfield that we've done in the past to build those into our self-built projects rather than acquiring EBITDA. So, I think on an opportunistic basis, there will be some acquisitions of operating data centers. But again, we feel that it is a better use of our capital to not just focus on buying EBITDA, but rather focusing on both, again, where our customers' requirements are and making sure that we can put together a product that is a very attractive to our customers as well. Thank you. Operator Thank you for the questions. Our next question will come from the line of Sara Wang from UBS. Please ask your question. Sara Wang -- UBS -- Analyst I have two questions. First is do -- regarding on client demand. So, under the government's new Eastern Data, Western Computing initiatives, do we see more intentions from our clients moving into the back, no matter if retail or wholesale clients? And the second question is that I think you have mentioned that 2023 sales target should be higher than 2022. Might I ask, what are the key assumptions here? What do you think is the key moving factor? So, meaning for the 2022 sales target, are we assuming, you know, macro or internet regulation or supply chain disruption? So, what are the key factors you think will moving our sales target? Thank you. Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC OK. I may want to take the first -- take the questions first and then work on Tim to provide additional color associated with that. I think both Tim and I, we mentioned about -- first of all, when we look at the whole market, we are -- we're actually bullish and we're bullish for reasons. Number one, you know, the government, you know, is providing a lot of great favorable policies, even further defined provide the directional guidance for Eastern Data, Western Computing. On the other hand, government also mentioned about the data is going to be key element for future production. And so, the data sovereignty, all of a sudden becomes like, you know, higher-order bids for every single enterprise to consider about for their cloud optimization. And number three, because, you know, I think the COVID basically accelerated digital transformation. And so, nowadays, a lot of our enterprises, for them to accelerate their digital transformation is to go to either capex to opex, reduce the capex, and then -- and focus on the opex in order to resonate with their business growth. On the other hand, they are continuing driving the cloud optimization. But in the past, they were probably one single public cloud, but the hybrid multicloud is going to become a new norm. And then the third one is to adopt every single thing as a service. And then because VNET, we're well-positioned that we have a dual-core growth engine, industry-leading ones. And so, for that one, we're very bullish about the future. The way we see that every single day, we see a great momentum. But on the other hand, we also have to be very cautious because the macroenvironment is beyond our control. We're talking about the China-U.S., you know, frenemy situation is a new norm. Industry-wise, there's going to be a power quota, power tariff. And also, you know, market-wise, you know, the customers, they're paying more attention on the cost. And there is also possibly a premium that we have to pay from the merger and acquisition point of view in a short period of time. And so, while we're bullish about the long term, but we're cautious in every single step we are taking. So, that's, you know, I would say the overall perspective. And then probably Tim can chime in with some of the additional input that we're seeing every single day and the cautious steps that we're taking. Tim, do you want to add additional color? Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, absolutely. And I would add to Samuel [Inaudible] of dig one layer deeper in terms of both what we've provided to the market in terms of guidance on cabinets, what Samuel is talking about in terms of the sort of sales. And I would link that then further to your questions around, you know, kind of how things look like in terms of, let's say, utilization rate assumptions. And, you know, with the delivery that we've made at the end of last year, you know, obviously, we do expect there to be a dip in terms of utilization rates, both due to a large number of deliveries, but also each year, we then reset, you know, the -- what cabinets are included under mature data centers, ramp-up, and so on and so forth. But the desire is also to make sure that we are finding a healthy balance between adding capacity, meeting our customers' requirements, but also looking at the now and today and seeing where the customers are in terms of ramping up and also where their demands are. And so, I think there is the desire to find that balance. And so, I think with the reduction in the total number of cabinets, we're also still targeting utilization rates of around 60%. And obviously, to the extent that we see customers ramping up faster, then we would speed up the deliveries. And in this case, right now, we are taking a more cautious approach because 2022 is not, as I said earlier on one of the other questions, you know, it's not 2020. And so, I think that we do need to find that balance then of making sure we deliver the right number of cabinets to match up with the ramp-up and the demands of our end customers. Operator Thank you for the questions. The next question comes from the line of Clive Cheung of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Clive Cheung -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Hi. Good morning, management. Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on the results. My first question is on some -- on margin. You mentioned for such in existing customers, there is an increasing trend of taking up more value-added services. So, my question is if assuming this is a long-term trend, how is this going to impact margins, if any? Thank you. Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC OK. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Go ahead, Samuel. So, why don't you start, and then I'll add to that. Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC Sure. OK. Again, thank you, Clive, for the question. Yes, we do see a big trend for customers to take on the value-added services. As I said, from a from a high-level perspective, you know, some of the uniqueness for China compared to the rest of the world, as I said before, is that while the rest of the world, you know, when enterprise is talking about the cloud transformation, they're basically three big players, which is AWS, Microsoft, and Google. But in China, we have more than a dozen cloud service providers. So, that's one thing. The second thing is why the data -- I would say privacy, transparency, computing, data sovereignty becomes the higher-order bit for enterprises to think about. Then they will probably develop a new strategy. Other than one single public cloud, they might choose to go with a hybrid multicloud in a way that they want to make sure the data will be stored at their discretion. And then -- so that's the second thing. The third one, because the COVID-19 really impact the whole industry, so most of the companies, at least in China, they were so willing to go with the opex-driven approach, instead of a capex-driven approach. Therefore, other than, you know, finding a partner to go with a colocation support, they want to have the partner, especially neutral partners, and they don't pick a side, but providing the full-stacked services, all the way from colocation support, the networking capabilities, and plus networking securities, and also the bare metal because they want to have a single tenant. They also want to have the O&M. They even want to have the hybrid cloud, multicloud management services and support, and so on so forth. And so, that gives VNET a great opportunity. And we saw that, and we graphed that as well. The question is whether those value-added services are like data center or wholesale play, which is pure EBITA-driven. And my answer to that is probably not because, you know, those are -- the software capabilities and service capabilities may not have enough or a lot of the amortization, depreciation of elements. And so, that's the reason. It may not be a pure apples-to-apples comparison for VNET versus our, I would say, IDC peer companies. But luckily, as you probably heard from, you know, some of our peer companies, they are seeing a huge retail tailwinds. They want to switch their focus to the retail engine. And so, I think, to some degree, that specific comments or statements endorse our growth strategy. So, I would say, you know, we're happy to have a strategy with the dual-core growth engine, and we're very proud to continue to execute on that strategy. Tim, do you have any additional input you want to make? Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer No, I think, Samuel, you gave a good overview of the types of businesses in the value-added services and how it works. So, you know, again, I think we can dive into some of the modeling side on the callbacks then. Clive Cheung -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Yeah, sure. Thank you. And my second question is in terms of the security of resources for our 2022 kind of expansion plans. How much of those are now secured? And actually, just that. Yeah, thank you. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Yup. So, no, I mean, we've obviously given out the list of the actual pipeline projects, and those are secure. We have included a range this year. And that's because in terms of an overall timing, I think people were asking about overall timing. We expect that a large portion of these will be actually at the end of the year. And so, we've included, from our experience already, the possibility that projects either would get shifted into '23 or pulled up. And so, we have included sort of others. And those are ones where, you know, I think there's uncertainty around the overall timetable from the customer point of view. So, overall, yes, these have been secured. It really is a matter of timing in terms of whether it comes in this side of '22 or the other side of '22 into '23. I hope that answers your question. Clive Cheung -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst OK. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Yup. Clive Cheung -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Tim. Operator Thank you for the questions. The next question will come from Ethan Zhang from Nomura. Please go ahead. Ethan Zhang -- Nomura -- Analyst [Inaudible] I know that you mentioned that -- we see that customers see more of value-added service for our retail IDC business. So, just wondering what's the outlook for our retail MRR in the FY '22 and going forward? And the second question is regarding the new IDC projects. I note that we have just had -- we have some hotel projects under construction in Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle, so just want to see your view on the IDC demands in that region because I think this will come new market opportunity. Thanks. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer OK. And maybe, Samuel, I'll take the MRR question, and then you want to take the second question? Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC Sure. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, look, in terms of MRR, and I'm happy you've sort of asked, you know, what the view of MRR for '22 is? You know, it will move around quarter to quarter, as you've seen last year as well. But we do expect that the MMR to stay in that sort of, you know, 9,000-plus range and then trending upwards as there are more and more value-added services that we sell to our customers. Obviously, some of the volatility comes around the fact that not all the customers when they first signed on is taking on the full package of services. And so, that's something which -- you know, the more cabinets we add, if they're more for what I call basic service or basic plus one versus a bundled solution of multiple services, I think that's going to affect the MRR. But I think, overall, MRR trend, again, we expect to be in a very positive trend going forward. Let me pass to you, Samuel, in terms of questions around the Chongqing region. Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC Yes. So, thank you, Ethan, for the questions. I think earlier this year, government has new directional guidance in terms of Eastern Data and also the Western Computing. So, if you look at the Eastern Data, Western Computing, and Chengdu and Chongqing area has been identified one of the eight regions. And then that specific region, together with Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, obviously, the Tier 1 cities, the four of them are actually defined as the Eastern Data. So, even though, sometimes, Chongqing are so like, you know, I would say a little bit kind of West compared to Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen from a geo perspective. But that specific area, you know, does have its promise from a business and also market perspective. And a lot of scenarios around, I would say, low latency, high bandwidth, and also no packet loss. So, ideally, for a region specialized to provide the Eastern Data per se. So, that's also one of the areas that we'll continue to invest. As a matter of fact, one of the projects in our 2022 is to talk about that specific areas. And we're seeing, I would say, great momentum picked up. If I look back to 2021 versus 2020, that's also one of the areas, start with small, but growing fast. So, we're very optimistic about the Chengdu and Chongqing areas. So, hopefully, that addressed your question, Ethan. Operator Thank you for the question. Next question comes from Albert Hung of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Albert Hung -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. I want to ask, how should we think about the competitive landscape going forward? Because I see two major factors. One, the government's new policy, East Data, West Computing is driving the customer into the remote areas while VNET has historically hedged in Tier 1 cities. Second, one of your competitors wants to focus more on retail business. So, I'm wondering how those two factor will affect your competitive landscape in the future? My second question is could you comment on the latest pricing in wholesale customer? As many of the large internet service providers are doing cost reduction, can you also comment down a bit on the future demand outlook? How should we get read it as the implication for pricing? Thank you. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Let me start -- thanks for the questions, by the way, Albert. Let me start with the question around sort of the retail side of the business in terms of I guess you've mentioned one of our peers wants to focus on the retail business. This is something which, you know, I think VNET has the history but also has built up the infrastructure to be able to service the customers -- the more complicated, actually, customer needs of the retail customers. It's not as simple as saying it's a retail customer, but using a colo model to service them. And so, we're very confident of the fact that we have a distinct competitive advantage in that. And we show in each of the quarters the ability to not only keep, but also then continue to add the retail customers to our base. But secondly, I think more importantly, and this is what Samuel was referring to earlier on, is the value-added services. Again, it's not just to sell a retail customer a colo service. And the whole reason why it is a very attractive proposition for them to come to VNET in the first place is the ability for them to come into a one-stop shop, a full stack of services, not having to deal with three, four, or five different vendors of the service. And I think that's a distinct advantage, which also then adds to the stickiness of the customer once they've come into our data centers. The second part of the question in terms of the, I guess, customer demand pricing side, maybe, Samuel, if you want to give a little bit of color to Albert? Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC Yes. So, first of all, I would say, first and foremost, it is great to have a dual-core growth engine basically to help us. The IDC service provider is to balance our, I would say, resources and priorities. Resources are finite while the opportunity are infinite. And so, when our peer companies, you know, focuses -- switched to the retail to a certain degree, endorse our strategy. And it is true that we're seeing great market opportunities and momentum in the retail front. You know, IDC business, overall, the wholesale and retail are sort of like, you know, kind of, you know, different kind of a way to look at it from a spectrum perspective. One focuses on the quantity, while the other focus on the qualities. The wholesale business gives us predictability and also give us the scale, while the retails probably gives us a very healthy margin and also the stickiness of the customers. And to some degree, it is easier for retail business to go wholesale, while it is super hard for the wholesale to enter into the retail because you have to have the relationship with the customers. You have to have the track records. You have to have the great networking capabilities and coverage. You have to have the whole bunch of value-added services. And your sale structure compensation package skillset is going to be so different. And so, it's not just about one company want to go to retail. Actually, every single IDC service providers want to have the dual-core growth engine, from my opinion. But it is hard. But again, I would say, in a given period of time, you know, everybody wants to do a wholesale business. But on the other hand, you know, when there's a storm coming to the wholesale front, and then a lot of the company want to go to retail as well. So, I would say, we're very fortunate to have the balance of strategy. And of course, as I mentioned earlier, we're super bullish about the future. But we're cautious about every single step we're taking because resources are finite. So, we want to make sure that we can optimize for a better business return. So, hopefully, that give, Albert, some of additional color for the questions. Albert Hung -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. In the interest of time, we'll now take the last questions from Gohan of Daiwa. Please go ahead. Unknown speaker Hello. I thank the management for the opportunity. My first question is regarding the deliveries guidance. So, are we being more cautious about the near-term outlook? So, is our capacity addition is more backend-loaded in '22, and what's our view on the deterioration around property value [Inaudible] for 2022? And my second question is about the recent -- the kinds of more in progress, and we see surging cases in Shanghai recent and also other Shenzhen regions. And we have -- what's our view on the impact of capacity delivery in these regions? And as we are expanding our account to be a more diversified customer mix, it's all better if can we provide a more revenue mix on Shanghai and the Beijing region. Thanks. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Let me take the first question, Gohan. Thank you very much for the question itself. In terms of the capacity, yes, I am expecting that more of the range of cabinets we're able to deliver will be in the latter part of the year. Next quarter, we'll be able to give you or give the market, as in previous quarters, a clear guidance on how much of it we're expecting within first half versus how much of it will be in the second half of the year. But it is very much in line with what was the case last year and that things will be more back-ended as we are taking a more cautious approach in terms of how quickly we deliver new capacity while we actually have our main focus is making sure that we ramp up the existing capacity. That leads to the second question, which is kind of what we're expecting in terms of the ramp in our utilization rate trend. I would say that you should see a dip, as I mentioned before, in the early part of the year, and that will slowly then increase during the course of the year to the end part of the year as the ramp-up continues across all of our different data centers. Samuel, do you want to take, I guess, the question around -- I think there were some questions around sort of customers move-in rates ramp-up progress. Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC No, I think you covered that pretty well. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC So, no, at least coming from me. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer OK. Thanks, Gohan.

Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC All right. Thank you, Xinyuan. Good morning, and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. During the second quarter, our focus remains on driving healthy results and delivering high-quality solutions and services to our customers. Our solid growth momentum across our business segments, amid macro challenges, clearly reflects the effectiveness of our growth strategy and our strong execution capabilities. On the operations front, total cabinets under management increased to approximately 80,800 by the end of the second quarter, compared with approximately 62,900 one year ago. At the same time, cabinets utilized by customers increased sequentially by approximately 1,500 to 44,500 by the end of the second quarter, compared with approximately 36,600 one year ago. Accordingly, the overall utilization rate maintained a sequential ramp-up, reaching 55.1% by the end of the second quarter. Our retail MRR per cabinet reached RMB 9,186, showing a healthy increase from the same period last year. On the financial front, we delivered a robust financial performance, with a year-over-year growth of 15.2% and 14.5% in revenue and adjusted EBITDA year over year, respectively. With the rapid growth of China's digital economy, we, as a leading IDT service provider, are in a good position to benefit from this growth momentum and local government support measures. This may the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held a consultative session and call for stronger efforts to boost development of the digital economy across the broad swath of industries. Technological empowerment was highlighted as a vital driver for higher quality economic growth. We believe this will carry immense potential to significantly amplify demand for IDC services. Within this environment, we are confident in our strength and our ability to capture exciting new growth opportunities. Next, let's take a closer look at the business update, starting with the recovery momentum from the impact of COVID resurgences. Encouragingly, in June, with the gradual easing of COVID-19-related lockdowns and mobility restrictions in Shanghai, Beijing, and Hebei province, we immediately resumed construction on new projects in these areas and have seen moving rates recovering steadily. Next, a review of our progress in key business segments during the quarter. Our wholesale business made solid progress in the second quarter. We once again extended our contract with an existing customer, a leading social platform in China, for building its network infrastructure in the northern region of China. This new order will generate total capacity of approximately 14 megawatts and further demonstrates our value proposition for this business segment. In addition, we recently signed a new contract of approximately 15 megawatts with the leading cloud service providers in China to build its network infrastructure in the Yangtze River Delta region. In the data center for this customer, aside from conventional air cooling, we will also offer liquid cooling solutions a more sustainable approach that will help reduce PUE and carbon emissions. Moving on to our retail business. Thanks to our diversified customer base. We are pleased to see our retail business growing steadily amid macro challenges. In the second quarter, we leveraged our technologies and expertise to cater to various vertical needs with a suite of very ag services, existing customer expansion, and new customer acquisition, both achieved impressive results, driven by rising digital demand from a wide variety of industries, such as local service, automobile, financial services, power manufacturing, and online gaming. Looking ahead, we plan to harvest our advanced engineering capabilities to reach our service portfolios, creating more value for our customers and generate more diverse revenue streams. On the Blue Cloud business front, we continue exploring opportunities that will allow us to diversify our industry-specific cloud solutions during the second quarter, we extended our manufacturing execution system, AKA MES to a leading automotive seating manufacturer in China. Through the delivery of MES, we help the customer, manage manufacturing flexibility, improve productivity and maximize efficiency by deploying digitalization, automation, and new technologies that will provide a real-time workflow visibility, flexibility, and insight into the entire manufacturing operations process from order release to ready to forge shipment. This system has been successfully implemented across all of our customers' production lines, and we're very pleased with the progress we have made in this area. In the meantime, we are actively accumulating more industry-specific expertise and look forward to tap into greater opportunities in the cloud business industry in the future. Despite macro headwinds, the unprecedented COVID-19 resurgence, and lockdowns in the first half of the year, our sustained growth highlighted our excellent business resealing and our ability to capture the rising demand for high-quality IDC services. However, in the near term, the uncertain economic outlook and threat of COVID-19 outbreaks may bring some short-term challenges to us. While the long-term demand trend is secure, taking into account the short-term challenges of the current slowdown environment and the impact from COVID-related disruptions. We are adjusting our outlook for the full year of 2022 and revising our full year delivery plan to the range of 9,400 to 12,400 cabinets from previously provided 14,400 to 17,400 cabinets. Going forward, we remain focused on our dual-core growth strategy, leveraging our scalable service offerings to drive growth and building our customer base across verticals. As the industry frontrunner and the fundamental link in China's digitalization change, we will see the opportunities from the nation's rapidly expanding and evolving digital economy, creating sustainable value for our stakeholders in the long term. Thank you, everyone. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Tim Chen, to discuss our financial performance for the quarter and our business outlook. Hi, Tim. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you very much, Samuel. Good morning, and good evening, everyone. Before we start the detailed discussion of our financials, please note that we will present non-GAAP measures today. In our non-GAAP results exclude certain noncash expenses, which are not part of our core operations. The details of these expenses may be found in the reconciliation tables included in our earnings press release. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, all the financials we present today are for the second quarter of 2022 and in renminbi terms. For the second quarter, again, we delivered a robust financial performance driven by rising demand from both our wholesale and retail businesses. Our solid financial position gives us a firm foundation to drive a long-term and sustainable growth, as we continue to leverage our scalable service offerings and build our customer base across a wider variety of industries. Next, let me walk you through our second quarter financial results. Unless otherwise specified, the growth rates I will be reviewing are all on a year-over-year basis. In the second quarter, our net revenue increased by 15.2% to RMB 1.72 billion from the same period last year, mainly due to increased customer demand, for our highly scalable carrier and cloud-neutral IDC solutions from both wholesale and retail IDC customers, as well as the continued growth of our cloud business. Gross profit was RMB 357.8 million in the second quarter of 2022, roughly flat, compared with the same period of 2021. Gross margin was 20.7% in the second quarter of 2022, compared to 24% in the same period of 2021. Adjusted cash gross profit, which excludes depreciation, amortization, and share-based composition expenses, was RMB 713.7 million in the second quarter of 2022, an increase of 11.5% from the same period of 2021. Adjusted cash gross margin in the second quarter of 2022 was 41.4%, compared to 42.8% in the same period of 2021. Adjusted operating the compensation for postcombination employment in acquisition and impairment of loan receivables to potential investees, were RMB 250.7 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared to RMB 235.6 million in the same period of 2021. As a percentage of net revenues, adjusted operating expenses in the second quarter of 2022 were 14.5%, compared to 15.7% in the same period of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2022 was RMB 486.9 million, representing an increase of 14.5% from the same period of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2022 excluded share-based compensation expenses of RMB 47.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter of 2022 was 28.2%, compared to 28.4% in the same period of 2021. Our net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders in the second quarter of 2022 was RMB 377.2 million, compared to a profit -- or a net profit of RMB 455.9 million in the same period of 2021. Basic and diluted loss were both RMB 0.43 per ordinary share and both RMB 2.58 per ADS. Each ADS represents six Class A ordinary shares. Turning to our balance sheet. As of June 30, 2022, the aggregate amount of the company's cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was RMB 3.62 billion. Meanwhile, net cash generated from operating activities in the second quarter of 2022 was RMB 942.7 million compared to RMB 314.8 million in the same period of 2021. Our capex in the second quarter of 2022 was RMB 540.6 million. And now on to our financial outlook. As Samuel mentioned, we faced the impact from COVID-related disruptions in the second quarter of 2022 on data center construction and customer moving schedules, and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties as well. As a result, we adjusted our outlook for 2022. Based on our current estimates, we expect our net revenues to be in the range of RMB 7,250 million to RMB 7,550 million and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of RMB 1,800 million to RMB 1,950 million. We always believe opportunities go alongside challenges. The COVID impacts are short term in nature, and digitalization is rapidly advancing in the wider society. Looking ahead, we will remain committed to advancing our dual-core growth strategy, broadening the spectrum of our services, increasing customer diversification, and capitalizing on the enormous opportunities presented by a thriving digital economy in China. This concludes our prepared remarks for today. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] First question comes from the line of Ethan Zhang from Nomura. Please proceed. Thank you. Ethan Zhang -- Nomura -- Analyst Thank you, management, for letting me ask the first question. So, I have two questions. So, the first one is, given the current situation of the electricity supplies in China, especially the heat wave in and surrounding areas, how do you see the trend of the utility cost in the second half of this year and the impact on our EBITDA margin? And second question is regarding the capex trend. So, I remember, we guided around RMB 5 billion capex for the full year 2022. But during the first half, since that we only completed a limited portion of our capex target. So, I just wonder, if we maintain the previous guidance on our capex spending for this year and how would we focus or target for capex spending in the second half of this year? Thank you. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you very much, Ethan. Let me take the first two questions. First, in terms of electricity, and impact of some of the areas, Sichuan, as an example, we do not expect to be a major increase in the electricity tariffs. However, in the areas that are impacted by electricity shortages, not dissimilar to last year and early parts of this year, where some of the data centers would need to switch over to diesel or we would actually acquire diesel in preparation for potential shortfalls in terms of electricity supply. I think that will show up in the figures for the second half, especially for anything in the affected areas. As to the capex and whether there are any changes to the capex guidance, we still expect to spend roughly in the range of RMB 4 billion and that's despite some of the capacity being pushed into 2023. As you know, these constructions do have a longer lead time. And so there will still be money being spent with regards to the power infrastructure, the buildings, and so forth. It would just be a slowdown a little bit, but we still expect that it will be for the full year around RMB 4 billion. I hope that answers your questions. Ethan Zhang -- Nomura -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you for the questions. Our next question comes from Edison Lee of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Edison Lee -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hi, morning, Samuel and Tim. Thank you very much for the presentation. I want to see what kind of power cost increases that you are assuming in your new guidance for the second half. And also, I want to know, what are the two new wholesale projects? What is the timing in terms of service launch and EBITDA contribution? Thanks. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Edison. Let me talk about the first one. So, in terms of the second half, we've assumed small increases in terms of coming from the power side. As you know, some of the power increases already took place in the first half. We do expect a little bit of further increases, but not in really the Tier 1 areas, but I would say the other areas the regions. We can go into some other the details later on, but not a very large increase. I think in the full year, we had given to the market previously, it was about a 1% margin impact I'd say that this moves the needle a little bit in the second half, but nothing that would be very material. Let me pass to Samuel to talk a little bit about the two wholesale wins. Thanks. Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC Sure. Thank you, Tim. And also thank you, Edison, for the questions. Regarding the wholesale wins, that we announced today, the social platform, it is actually an existing customers, but with a new contract. And basically, a country signed in the second quarter. And then for another one, which is public cloud service providers. And then we're expecting to sign the contract in Q3. And we're very pleased because spend quite a bit of time working with the customers and finally secure a design win. So that's pretty encouraging for us. Edison Lee -- Jefferies -- Analyst Sorry, Samuel. Can you talk about the timing of these contracts coming into service? And -- Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC Oh, yeah. As I said, the social platform wins, that would be second quarter, this quarter. And then for public cloud service providers, the contract will be signed in Q3. And we expect this to be serviced and the ramp-up starting from Q4, this year. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer OK. So, Edison, both of these, I would say, are small or negligible contribution in 2022, but the ramp-ups should be within 2023. Edison Lee -- Jefferies -- Analyst So, is the ramp-up period also two years for these two projects? Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer They should actually be quite quick. Again, contractually, as you know, our customers will sign a commitment but what we've seen at least from the customers that we've just talked about. They can actually ramp up, extremely quickly. So, I would say, at the moment, probably assuming that most of the ramp-up should be within 2023 for these projects. Edison Lee -- Jefferies -- Analyst OK. Thank you, Tim. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Most welcome. Operator Thank you for the questions. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Alex Wang from Daiwa Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Alex Wang -- Daiwa Capital Markets -- Analyst Thanks, management. So, my first question is regarding our pipeline, I understood that we cut our capacity addition plan in the near term. But I understand that we currently forecast roughly 17,000 for 2023-2024 capacity addition. So, I want to have more color on the spend. Do we have any change on two years guidance? And the second thing is about the utilization run-up, so how do you say ramp-up acceleration in exciting projects starting from June? So, could we add more color on the current utilization rate for existing wholesale projects in service, and given current macro and the current situation, I want to have more sense about what's the typical period for this kind of capacity rate, normalized utilization rate? Thanks. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Alex. Let me take the first question in terms of the pipeline. You're correct. I think previously, we had a range from 14,400 to 17,400 in terms of the cabinet deliveries in 2022. We did revise down, down to a range of 9,400 to 12,400. You'll see the details that we've included in the IR PPT, that be uploaded to our website. But -- so that is the range of guidance down from the 17.4 that you discussed earlier on. You'll see that the projects that we've taken out, again some of these, we expect to take place in 2023. There's some related to construction slowdowns and then others related to customer demand being pushed back. And so rather than have everything ramped up in terms of delivering the cabinets and then waiting for the customer, we decided to also then match our pace of delivery with the customer requirements as well. For the second question, maybe I'll pass to Samuel, and he can address that for you. Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC Yeah. In terms of the ramp-up for our wholesale customers, what happened is most of the customers basically from the contract, we're committed to have two years to ramp up to hit the 90% or even higher utilization rates. But in reality, from our experiences and by talking to the customers, given their business growth normally will be within a year, they basically hit the 90% or even higher. And so, for the two MOU that we talked about today, including the social platform and public cloud service providers, we have a high expectation that can ramp up to 90% or even higher within a year period of time, given the current forecast. And then separately, from a retail point of view, we're also seeing a momentum from the customer digital transformation trend as well. So, I would say, given, even though, with the macro conditions, a little bit uncertain. But the part -- business is pretty solid in the quarter ahead of time. Alex Wang -- Daiwa Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Sara Wang from UBS. Please proceed. Sara Wang -- UBS -- Analyst Hi, Sam and team. Thanks for the opportunity to ask a question. So, I have two questions. First is still on the delivery target. I mean, I asked what's the split between wholesale and retail of the delivery target of covenants. And another question is, so what's the increased magnitude or what's the magnitude of power tariff increase in the second quarter? I noticed that our adjusted EBITDA margin actually stayed relatively stable versus last -- so just what means if there's any other area, we can actually save cost to offset the power tariff increase? Thank you. Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC Hi, Sara. Can you repeat the first part of the question, please, again? Sara Wang -- UBS -- Analyst Hi. The first question is what's the split between wholesale and retail orders of our delivery target? Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC OK. Thank you. Let me handle that first question. I'd say that right now, the split between the wholesale and retail, we're still looking at a similar split of around 60-40. So, we've talked about, again, in the past 60-20, 20-60 being the wholesale and then scale retail and retail. So, we still expect that to be the same in that range more than half being wholesale related, maybe up to two-thirds being wholesale related. In terms of the power increases, again, the vast majority of the increase that we saw were in the Tier 1 cities. Again, the earlier part of the year, we saw them go up by anywhere from 10% to 20% in the Tier 1 cities. And so, we factored in the impact to the full year margins. In Quarter 1, we did have some tax rebates and other income, and then that's kind of some of the reasons behind why the margins in the first quarter weren't impacted as much. And then in the second quarter, there were some costs incurred there. But again, we have been quite focused on making sure we help to implement cost controls. So, we'll continue to do that in the third and fourth quarter, but there are going to be limits to how much we can do to offset increases in our operating costs in general. Hope that helps, Sara. Sara Wang -- UBS -- Analyst Got it. Thank you. Operator Thank you for the questions. The next question comes from the line of Albert Hung of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Albert Hung -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Hi, Samuel and Tim. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is, if I look at the 2022 new guidance, the EBITDA margin in a second half adjusted EBITDA could be like 22%, which is a multiyear low. Going now further on the one-off structural margin drag in second half, how does it drive the margin recovery in the next year? And the second question is the decline in revenue is mainly driven by wholesale or pro-based IDC demand weakness. And from your point of view, how long did you expect that the downside to will not? Historically, our spending will be the leading indicator for IDC, and right now, the average spending looks still quite weak in second half. Does that imply, first half of next year, we'll also see the slowdown in IDC? Thank you. Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC OK. Thank you, Albert. Let me take the first part of the question, and then maybe Tim can help to chime in with additional contacts. I think as Tim pointed out, the very -- the first quarter of the year because we did have the tax subsidies and annual reimbursement from the depository bank. And then so by removing the one-time thing and then the second quarter margin is pretty much on par. However, with the revised guidance, as you can see our second half EBITDA margin is going to be roughly about a 22% ratio. I would say in a nutshell, aside from the fact that some of the cost and expense got delayed to the second half due to the COVID outbreak, the lockdown in the first half. We are also expecting some of the support revenue in the pipeline. Basically, for new retail customer acquisition and then, as well as some of the increased engineering cost, mainly focusing on the investment ahead of revenue type. And so that basically impacts our EBITDA margin in the second half. So, a lot of the analysts are asking about the power tariffs or even our data center maintenance and upgrade, I think both electrical and mechanical parts, although not really material data center, but if we add up, it is still a month in the P&L. So that basically impacts the EBITDA ratio in the second half. Are we expecting -- that will continue going on? We strongly doubt because a lot of the costs basically impact in the second half, it's more seasonality -- and so we're expecting to have the improvement in 2023. And then Tim, do you want to take on the second question? Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer In terms of the -- you're asking about how long this will last for, I think Samuel started to address that and kind of will this drag into 2023 in terms of leading indicators. I would say that in our shifting of some of the capacity deliveries through 2023, alongside or matching with the customer demands is that we already see some of the things that they had initially wanted by end of the year being pushed into the sort of first half of 2023. So, there is that visibility that customers still intend to require these data centers, but it has been shifted backwards. In terms of which area, we've kind of seen, let's say, the slower ramp-ups, I would say, just given the sheer scale of the ramp-up pace of a wholesale customer versus a retail customer, I would say that it is more on the wholesale side. They are a sort of larger contributor in terms of billable cabinet ramp-up. But it's not to say that we've not seen a sort of similar slower pace during the times that there were lockdowns in place. We certainly hope that we see less and less of these steps of lockdowns in the second half. And so, then customers can actually resume a more normal pace of ramp-up during the rest of this year and into next year Albert Hung -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Thank you. Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC Questions? Operator Our next question comes from the line of Clive Cheung from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Clive Cheung -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Hi. Thank you, management, for taking my question. I have two questions. The first one is regarding wholesale demand. So, for the move-ins you have seen for the existing customers we have had or existing orders. How different is that, say, in terms of months required for ramp-up, [Technical difficulty] is different to our previous expectations, say, previous guidance versus our new guidance? That's number one question. The second question is the MSR. I see there is a small decline in retail MSR for two quarters running, quarter on quarter. I was wondering, is there any trends we should pick up here, or should we still expect them to be broadly in line, or previously, you mentioned slightly upwards in the longer term? Thank you. Two questions. Samuel Shen -- Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of Retail IDC Thank you, Clive. I would say, from the wholesale customers' point of view, basically, I think Tim and I, we talked about specifically two types of the wholesale customers we're talking to almost on a weekly basis; the public cloud service providers and social platforms and especially for video type of customers, who require a huge storage to store the data. I would say, we're not seeing any difference from their move-in rates, aside from the COVID-19 impact or lockdowns impact and so on and so forth. Their business continues to grow. And then -- so when we talk to them, they proactively plan their demand forecast and do the site selection. And then, when we participate and win a bid, it is not just a one-time deal; it is more like lifetime partnership, and so on and so forth. So, again, from our partnership, we've seen the similar trend from a moving rate perspective. So that's the reason when Tim and I, we talked about, aside from what contractual say, two years commit to ramp up to 90%. We've actually seen the actual results way more faster than that. So, again, with the two MOU that we talked about today, hopefully, we're seeing exactly the same trend as we talked about. Tim, do you want to address the monthly recurring revenue for the retail one? Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure. In terms of the monthly recurring revenue, I think, the main thing is quarter to quarter, you will see some fluctuation, and that's because the figure there is a total retail-related revenue divided by cabinets. We do expect that these levels will remain around 9,000. And Clive, you're absolutely correct in your second part of your statement, which is whether or not we expect this longer term to trend upwards. I think the answer is definitely yes. And that's going to be driven by some of the investments that Samuel mentioned earlier on. The investments on the retail services side that will then allow us to provide, again, a larger suite of services to the customers and expand then the contribution of the value-added services to the overall MRR. So again, longer term, expected to trend up, but I think quarter to quarter to quarter, roughly fluctuating around the 9,000 level. I hope that helps. Clive Cheung -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Thank you very much, Samuel and Tim. Thank you. Operator Thank you for the questions. Your next question comes from the line of Hongjie Li of CICC. Please proceed with your question. Hongjie Li -- CICC -- Analyst Hi, management. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions. First one is based on the current wholesale and retail demand, could you share more about the delivery pipeline and capex plan in recent years like in 2023? And my second question is regarding the utility cost. We're cueing some regions in China, there's a par supply shortage. Is there any material impact for us and traditional detail about the future trend you think of the utility costs and the impact on our margin? Thanks. Tim Chen -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Let me take the two questions. In terms of, I guess, capex and delivery plans for 2023, I would say that based on the fact that some of the capacity we had planned for 2022 being shifted into 2023. I would say year on year, we would expect that the capacity in terms of megawatts will be larger in 2023 as compared to 2022 clearly, as things ramp up again and also as some of the construction delays ease, hopefully, as we see a COVID -- less COVID impact year in 2023.And so, capex also, we talked about earlier on that we still expect capex spend to be around RMB 4 billion this year. Next year, it likely will be higher than that, as we then continue to build out the capacity, especially with the additional MOU wins. Those will then clearly form part of what we see in terms of the spend in -- for the latter part of this year, but also then into next year in terms of expected future tender wins as well. The second question, in terms of power. Again, the cost that we're seeing is largely similar to the last time around where we -- there were power shortages around China, and these were related to mostly short-term purchases of diesel fuel and making sure that our data centers continue operating when there was uncertainty in terms of continued power supply from the grid, so these are the costs that we expect to see. Again, on a single data center basis, these are not material if they persist or if they start to spread throughout China, then it will become a larger figure. But at the moment, I think largely covered in what we've already provided to the market in terms of what our views are for the second half and balance of the year. I hope that helps.

        "Extracted Text": "Higher-than-expected revenue wasn't enough for investors. What: Shares of data center company 21Vianet Group (VNET 14.79%) fell as much as 14.3% following its second-quarter earnings report, which was released on Tuesday after market close. At the time of this writing, the stock is down about 12.6% during the trading day. The stock's sell-off on Wednesday was likely driven by the company's worse-than-expected adjusted loss per share. IMAGE SOURCE: 21VIANET. So what: 21Vianet reported revenue of 910.8 million RMB, or $137.2 million, rising 5.1% from the year-ago quarter. The company's adjusted loss per share was $0.17. These results were mixed compared to analysts' expectations. On average, analysts were expecting 21Vianet to report revenue and EPS of $128.2 million and a loss of $0.09 per share, respectively. 21Vianet Group CEO Steve Zhang admitted in the company's second-quarter press release that 21Vianet experienced \"headwinds in certain markets,\" but said the company is \"pleased to report that core business areas, including IDC, Cloud and VPN gained solid growth momentum in the second quarter.\" 21Vianet's worse-than-expected loss is likely related to the company's pricing pressure in its managed network services, which CFO Terry Wang said \"continued to limit our top line growth\" in the segment. Now what: Going forward, Wang asserts the company is making progress on its cost-control efforts -- a feat he believes will play a role in helping \"reignite margin growth going forward,\" he said. \"[W]e are pleased with our operations team's progress on cost control front,\" Wang said, \"which is yet to be fully reflected in our quarterly financial results and should yield positive results in the coming quarters.\" Daniel Sparks has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(NASDAQ: EGHT), the industry's most integrated Platform for CX that combines Contact Center, Unified Communication, and CPaaS APIs, today reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 ended December 31, 2024. \"Our third quarter results highlight further progress and continued momentum in our transformation journey. We delivered solid financial performance, with record cash flow from operations and strong adoption of our AI-powered customer experience solutions, driving a 60% year-over-year increase in new products. As we move forward, our focus remains on enhancing customer value, accelerating growth, and driving long-term profitability. With a clear strategy and a strong team, I believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead,\" said Samuel Wilson, Chief Executive Officer at 8x8, Inc. Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results: \"We delivered solid service and total revenue performance relative to our guidance, despite unfavorable foreign exchange rates compared to the rates prevailing when we established our outlook for the quarter. Additionally, record cash flow from operations further reinforced our confidence in our ability to consistently generate cash. As a result, we were comfortable making an additional $15 million term loan prepayment in January, further strengthening our balance sheet and positioning us for long-term financial flexibility,\" said Kevin Kraus, Chief Financial Officer at 8x8, Inc. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other information relating to non-GAAP measures is included in the supplemental reconciliation at the end of this release. Recent Business Highlights: 8x8 Platform for CX innovation The latest innovations leverage AI-driven automation, advanced security, and seamless integrations to simplify complex operations and enhance efficiency for customers. Key enhancements include: 8x8 Technology Partner Ecosystem Expansion New Brand and Messaging Reflects CX Transformation Recognition for the 8x8 Platform for CX, Contact Center, Customer Service and Sustainable Business Practices Corporate and Leadership Updates Fourth Quarter and Updated Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Outlook: Management provides expected ranges for total revenue, service revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP net income per share, diluted, based on its evaluation of the current business environment. The Company emphasizes that these expectations are subject to various important cautionary factors referenced in the section entitled \"Forward-Looking Statements\" below. Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Ending March 31, 2025 Fiscal Year 2025 Ending March 31, 2025 The Company does not reconcile its forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP operating margin to the corresponding GAAP measure of GAAP operating margin or non-GAAP net income per share, basic and diluted, to the corresponding GAAP measure of GAAP net income (loss) per share due to the significant variability of, and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections with regards to, the various expenses excluded by these metrics. For example, future hiring and employee turnover may not be reasonably predictable, stock-based compensation expense depends on variables that are largely not within the control of nor predictable by management, such as the market price of 8x8 common stock, and may also be significantly impacted by events like acquisitions, the timing and nature of which are difficult to predict with accuracy. The actual amounts of these excluded items could have a significant impact on the Company's GAAP operating margin and GAAP net income per share, basic and diluted. Accordingly, management believes that reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their corresponding GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable effort. See the \"Explanation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\" below for the definition of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP net income per share, basic and diluted. All projections are on a non-GAAP basis. Additionally, our increased emphasis on profitability and cash flow generation may not be successful. The reduction in our total costs as a percentage of revenue may negatively impact our revenue and our business in ways we don't anticipate and may not achieve the desired outcome.

Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: a reduction in our total costs as a percentage of revenue may negatively impact our revenues and our business; customer adoption and demand for our products may be lower than we anticipate; the impact of economic downturns on us and our customers; ongoing volatility and conflict in the political environment; inflationary pressures and rising interest rates; competitive dynamics of the cloud communication and collaboration markets, including voice, contact center, video, messaging, and communication application programming interfaces, as well as our competitors' use of AI, in which we compete, may change in ways we are not anticipating; third parties may assert ownership rights in our IP, which may limit or prevent our continued use of the core technologies behind our solutions; our customer churn rate may be higher than we anticipate; our investments in marketing, channel and value-added resellers, new products, and our acquisition of Fuze, Inc. may not result in meeting our revenue or operating margin targets we forecast in our guidance, for a particular quarter or for the full fiscal year. Our increased emphasis on profitability and cash flow generation may not be successful. The reduction in our total costs as a percentage of revenue may negatively impact our revenue and our business in ways we do not anticipate and may not achieve the desired outcome. For a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, see \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, as well as other reports that 8x8, Inc. files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Explanation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation The Company has provided in this release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage, and evaluate the business, and to make operating decisions. Management believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating the Company's ongoing operational performance. Management also believes that some of 8x8\u2019s investors use these Non-GAAP financial measures as an additional tool in evaluating 8x8's \"core operating performance\" in the ordinary, ongoing, and customary course of the Company's operations. Core operating performance excludes items that are non-cash, not expected to recur, or not reflective of ongoing financial results. Management also believes that looking at the Company\u2019s core operating performance provides consistency in period-to-period comparisons and trends. These Non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies, which limits the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes. Management recognizes that these Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, including the fact that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of items to exclude from the Non-GAAP financial information. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the table titled \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\". Detailed explanations of the adjustments from comparable GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures are as follows: Non-GAAP Costs of Revenue, Costs of Service Revenue and Costs of Other Revenue Non-GAAP Costs of Revenue includes: (i) Non-GAAP Cost of Service Revenue, which is Cost of Service Revenue excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, and certain severance, transition and contract exit costs; and (ii) Non-GAAP Cost of Other Revenue, which is Cost of Other Revenue excluding stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, and certain severance, transition and contract exit costs. Non-GAAP Service Revenue Gross Margin, Other Revenue Gross Margin, and Total Revenue Gross Margin Non-GAAP Service Revenue Gross Profit and Margin as a percentage of Service Revenue and Non-GAAP Other Revenue Gross Profit and Margin as a percentage of Other Revenue are computed as Service Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Service Revenue divided by Service Revenue and Other Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Other Revenue divided by Other Revenue, respectively. Non-GAAP Total Revenue Gross Profit and Margin as a percentage of Total Revenue is computed as Total Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Service Revenue and Non-GAAP Cost of Other Revenue divided by Total Revenue. Management believes the Company\u2019s investors benefit from understanding these adjustments and from an alternative view of the Company\u2019s Cost of Service Revenue and Cost of Other Revenue, as well as the Company's Service, Other and Total Revenue Gross Margin performance compared to prior periods and trends. Non-GAAP Operating Profit and Non-GAAP Operating Margin Non-GAAP Operating Profit excludes: amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, certain legal and regulatory costs, certain severance, transition and contract exit costs, and impairment of long-lived assets from Operating Profit (Loss). Non-GAAP Operating Margin is Non-GAAP Operating Profit divided by Revenue. Management believes that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of the Company\u2019s ongoing operating performance. Non-GAAP Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA Non-GAAP Net Income excludes: amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, certain legal and regulatory costs, certain severance, transition and contract exit costs, impairment of long-lived assets, amortization of debt discount and issuance cost, loss on debt extinguishment, gain on remeasurement of warrants, and other income. Adjusted EBITDA excludes interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation, amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, and other income (expense), net from non-GAAP net income. Management believes the Company\u2019s investors benefit from understanding these adjustments and an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to prior periods and trends. Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share \u2013 Basic and Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share - Diluted Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share \u2013 Basic is Non-GAAP Net Income divided by the weighted-average basic shares outstanding. Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share \u2013 Diluted is Non-GAAP Net Income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. Diluted shares outstanding include the effect of potentially dilutive securities from stock-based benefit plans and convertible senior notes. These potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of net loss per share attributable to common stockholders on a GAAP basis because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. They are added for the computation of diluted net income per share on a non-GAAP basis in periods when 8x8 has net profit on a non-GAAP basis as their inclusion provides a better indication of 8x8\u2019s underlying business performance. Management believes the Company\u2019s investors benefit by understanding our Non-GAAP net income performance as reflected in a per share calculation as ways of measuring performance by ownership in the Company. Management believes these adjustments offer investors a useful view of the Company\u2019s diluted net income per share as compared to prior periods and trends. Management evaluates and makes decisions about its business operations based on Non-GAAP financial information by excluding items management does not consider to be \u201ccore costs\u201d or \u201ccore proceeds.\u201d Management believes some of its investors also evaluate our \"core operating performance\" as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary, ongoing, and customary course of our operations. Management excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets, which primarily represents a non-cash expense of technology and/or customer relationships already developed, to provide a supplemental way for investors to compare the Company\u2019s operations pre-acquisition to those post-acquisition and to those of our competitors that have pursued internal growth strategies. Stock-based compensation expense has been excluded because it is a non-cash expense and relies on valuations based on future conditions and events, such as the market price of 8x8 common stock, that are difficult to predict and/or largely not within the control of management. The related employer payroll taxes for stock-based compensation are excluded since they are incurred only due to the associated stock-based compensation expense. Acquisition and integration expenses consist of external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition and strategic investment activities such as legal and other professional services, due diligence, integration, and other closing costs, which are costs that vary significantly in amount and timing. Legal and regulatory costs include litigation and other professional services, as well as certain tax and regulatory liabilities. Severance, transition and contract exit costs include employee termination benefits, executive severance agreements, and cancellation of certain contracts and lease impairments. Debt amortization expenses relate to the non-cash accretion of the debt discount. 8x8, INC.

        "Extracted Text": "CAMPBELL, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--8x8, Inc. (NASDAQ: EGHT), a leading business communications, CX, and Communications Platform as a Service provider, today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 ended September 30, 2024. Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results: \"We are pleased to report a solid quarter, with results that reflect the early signs of success of our investments in innovation and our transformation strategy,\" said Samuel Wilson, Chief Executive Officer at 8x8, Inc. \"With strong growth in usage revenue, acceleration in the sales of new products, and high retention on the 8x8 platform, it's clear our innovation-led approach resonates in today's competitive CX landscape. I\u2019m grateful to our customers, partners, and employees who have embraced our mission of unlocking the power of every interaction.\" A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other information relating to non-GAAP measures is included in the supplemental reconciliation at the end of this release. Recent Business Highlights: Product Innovation Highlights Industry Recognition Corporate, ESG and Leadership Updates Third Quarter and Updated Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Outlook: Management provides expected ranges for total revenue, service revenue and non-GAAP operating margin based on its evaluation of the current business environment. The Company emphasizes that these expectations are subject to various important cautionary factors referenced in the section entitled \"Forward-Looking Statements\" below. Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Ending December 31, 2024 Fiscal Year 2025 Ending March 31, 2025 The Company does not reconcile its forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP operating margin to the corresponding GAAP measure of GAAP operating margin due to the significant variability of, and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections with regards to, the various expenses excluded by this metric. For example, future hiring and employee turnover may not be reasonably predictable, stock-based compensation expense depends on variables that are largely not within the control of nor predictable by management, such as the market price of 8x8 common stock, and may also be significantly impacted by events like acquisitions, the timing and nature of which are difficult to predict with accuracy. The actual amounts of these excluded items could have a significant impact on the Company's GAAP operating margin. Accordingly, management believes that reconciliations of this forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the corresponding GAAP measure are not available without unreasonable effort. See the \"Explanation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\" below for the definition of non-GAAP operating margin. All projections are on a non-GAAP basis. Additionally, our increased emphasis on profitability and cash flow generation may not be successful.

Explanation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation The Company has provided in this release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage, and evaluate the business, and to make operating decisions. Management believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating the Company's ongoing operational performance. Management also believes that some of 8x8\u2019s investors use these Non-GAAP financial measures as an additional tool in evaluating 8x8's ongoing \"core operating performance\" in the ordinary, ongoing, and customary course of the Company's operations. Core operating performance excludes items that are non-cash, not expected to recur, or not reflective of ongoing financial results. Management also believes that looking at the Company\u2019s core operating performance provides consistency in period-to-period comparisons and trends. These Non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies, which limits the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes. Management recognizes that these Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, including the fact that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of items to exclude from the Non-GAAP financial information. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the table titled \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\". Detailed explanations of the adjustments from comparable GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures are as follows: Non-GAAP Costs of Revenue, Costs of Service Revenue and Costs of Other Revenue Non-GAAP Costs of Revenue includes: (i) Non-GAAP Cost of Service Revenue, which is Cost of Service Revenue excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, and certain severance, transition and contract exit costs; and (ii) Non-GAAP Cost of Other Revenue, which is Cost of Other Revenue excluding stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, and certain severance, transition and contract exit costs. Non-GAAP Service Revenue Gross Margin, Other Revenue Gross Margin, and Total Revenue Gross Margin Non-GAAP Service Revenue Gross Profit and Margin as a percentage of Service Revenue and Non-GAAP Other Revenue Gross Profit and Margin as a percentage of Other Revenue are computed as Service Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Service Revenue divided by Service Revenue and Other Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Other Revenue divided by Other Revenue, respectively. Non-GAAP Total Revenue Gross Profit and Margin as a percentage of Total Revenue is computed as Total Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Service Revenue and Non-GAAP Cost of Other Revenue divided by Total Revenue. Management believes the Company\u2019s investors benefit from understanding these adjustments and from an alternative view of the Company\u2019s Cost of Service Revenue and Cost of Other Revenue, as well as the Company's Service, Other and Total Revenue Gross Margin performance compared to prior periods and trends. Non-GAAP Operating Profit and Non-GAAP Operating Margin Non-GAAP Operating Profit excludes: amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, certain legal and regulatory costs, and certain severance, transition and contract exit costs from Operating Profit (Loss). Non-GAAP Operating Margin is Non-GAAP Operating Profit divided by Revenue. Management believes that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of the Company\u2019s ongoing operating performance. Non-GAAP Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA Non-GAAP Net Income excludes: amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, certain legal and regulatory costs, certain severance, transition and contract exit costs, amortization of debt discount and issuance cost, loss on debt extinguishment, gain on remeasurement of warrants, and other income. Adjusted EBITDA excludes interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation, amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, and other income (expense), net from non-GAAP net income. Management believes the Company\u2019s investors benefit from understanding these adjustments and an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to prior periods and trends. Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share \u2013 Basic and Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share - Diluted Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share \u2013 Basic is Non-GAAP Net Income divided by the weighted-average basic shares outstanding. Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share \u2013 Diluted is Non-GAAP Net Income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. Diluted shares outstanding include the effect of potentially dilutive securities from stock-based benefit plans and convertible senior notes. These potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of net loss per share attributable to common stockholders on a GAAP basis because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. They are added for the computation of diluted net income per share on a non-GAAP basis in periods when 8x8 has net profit on a non-GAAP basis as their inclusion provides a better indication of 8x8\u2019s underlying business performance. Management believes the Company\u2019s investors benefit by understanding our Non-GAAP net income performance as reflected in a per share calculation as ways of measuring performance by ownership in the Company. Management believes these adjustments offer investors a useful view of the Company\u2019s diluted net income per share as compared to prior periods and trends. Management evaluates and makes decisions about its business operations based on Non-GAAP financial information by excluding items management does not consider to be \u201ccore costs\u201d or \u201ccore proceeds.\u201d Management believes some of its investors also evaluate our \"core operating performance\" as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary, ongoing, and customary course of our operations. Management excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets, which primarily represents a non-cash expense of technology and/or customer relationships already developed, to provide a supplemental way for investors to compare the Company\u2019s operations pre-acquisition to those post-acquisition and to those of our competitors that have pursued internal growth strategies. Stock-based compensation expense has been excluded because it is a non-cash expense and relies on valuations based on future conditions and events, such as the market price of 8x8 common stock, that are difficult to predict and/or largely not within the control of management. The related employer payroll taxes for stock-based compensation are excluded since they are incurred only due to the associated stock-based compensation expense. Acquisition and integration expenses consist of external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition and strategic investment activities such as legal and other professional services, due diligence, integration, and other closing costs, which are costs that vary significantly in amount and timing. Legal and regulatory costs include litigation and other professional services, as well as certain tax and regulatory liabilities. Severance, transition and contract exit costs include employee termination benefits, executive severance agreements, and cancellation of certain contracts. Debt amortization expenses relate to the non-cash accretion of the debt discount. 8x8, INC.

Recent Business Highlights: Product Innovation Highlights Industry Recognition Corporate ESG and Leadership Updates Early Repayment of Term Loan Due in 2027 In early July 2024, the Company secured a new $200 million Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Facility (the \u201cDelayed Draw Term Loan\u201d) from Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, MUFG Bank, LTD, Silicon Valley Bank (a division of First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company), Citibank, and City National Bank. On August 5, 2024, the Company used the proceeds from the Delayed Draw Term Loan, plus approximately $29 million from existing cash balances, to fund the early repayment of the entire $225 million outstanding, plus accrued interest and fees, on the existing term loan with Francisco Partners. \u201cWe achieved an important milestone in our stated objective to return value to shareholders by reducing debt with the repayment of the remaining $225 million outstanding on our term loan with Francisco Partners, funded in part by a new bank loan for $200 million,\u201d said Kevin Kraus, Chief Financial Officer at 8x8, Inc. \u201cSince August 2022, we have reduced the total principal outstanding on our debt, including convertible notes, by $146 million, or 27%. We intend to continue to return value to our shareholders by reducing our term loan obligations in the future. \u201cThe quality of the commercial banks involved in the new credit facility and the favorable interest rate on the new loan reflect our financial strength, as well as our lenders\u2019 confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term profitability and cash flow objectives,\u201d added Kraus. Second Quarter and Updated Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Outlook: Management provides expected ranges for total revenue, service revenue and non-GAAP operating margin based on its evaluation of the current business environment. The Company emphasizes that these expectations are subject to various important cautionary factors referenced in the section entitled \"Forward-Looking Statements\" below. Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Ending September 30, 2024 Fiscal Year 2025 Ending March 31, 2025 The Company does not reconcile its forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP operating margin to the corresponding GAAP measure of GAAP operating margin due to the significant variability of, and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections with regards to, the various expenses excluded by this metric. For example, future hiring and employee turnover may not be reasonably predictable, stock-based compensation expense depends on variables that are largely not within the control of nor predictable by management, such as the market price of 8x8 common stock, and may also be significantly impacted by events like acquisitions, the timing and nature of which are difficult to predict with accuracy. The actual amounts of these excluded items could have a significant impact on the Company's GAAP operating margin. Accordingly, management believes that reconciliations of this forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the corresponding GAAP measure are not available without unreasonable effort. See the Explanation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation below for the definition of non-GAAP operating margin. All projections are on a non-GAAP basis. Additionally, our increased emphasis on profitability and cash flow generation may not be successful. The reduction in our total costs as a percentage of revenue may negatively impact our revenue and our business in ways we don't anticipate and may not achieve the desired outcome. Conference Call Information: Management will host a conference call to discuss earnings results on August 7, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time). The conference call will last approximately 60 minutes. Participants may: Participants should plan to dial in or log on 10 minutes prior to the start time. The webcast will be archived on 8x8's website for a period of at least 30 days. For additional information, visit https://8x8.gcs-web.com/. About 8x8, Inc. 8x8, Inc.

Key Business Metrics In the past, the Company has analyzed trends in annualized recurring and usage revenue, or ARR. Our product offering is evolving to address trends in our industry, which include increased use of self-service chat bots, automated digital communications, and messaging. These solutions are often unrelated to user-based subscriptions and are typically sold based on consumption. We expect usage revenue to increase in the future, making our previously disclosed Annual Recurring Subscriptions and Usage Revenue (ARR) metric less relevant moving forward. Based on our expectation of higher platform usage revenue, and following an evaluation of key business metrics disclosed by our peers in the UCaaS, CCaaS and CPaaS markets, we are discontinuing the use of ARR, as previously defined, as a key business metric. We intend to continue to review our key business metrics as our markets and business model evolve. Forward Looking Statements: This news release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"strategy,\" \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements, include but are not limited to: changing industry trends; the size of our market opportunity; the potential success and impact of our investments in AI; our strategic framework; our ability to increase profitability and cash flow to deleverage our balance sheet and fund investment in innovation; whether our UC and CC traffic will increase; whether we can increase customer retention; our future revenue and growth (including platform usage revenue); whether we can sustain an increasing pace of innovation; the success of our go-to-market engine; our ability to improve general and administrative synergies; our ability to enhance shareholder value; and our financial outlook, revenue growth, and profitability, including whether we will achieve sustainable growth and profitability. You should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: a reduction in our total costs as a percentage of revenue may negatively impact our revenues and our business; customer adoption and demand for our products may be lower than we anticipate; the impact of economic downturns on us and our customers; ongoing volatility and conflict in the political environment, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and war in the Middle East; inflationary pressures and rising interest rates; competitive dynamics of the cloud communication and collaboration markets, including voice, contact center, video, messaging, and communication application programming interfaces, in which we compete may change in ways we are not anticipating; third parties may assert ownership rights in our IP, which may limit or prevent our continued use of the core technologies behind our solutions; our customer churn rate may be higher than we anticipate; our investments in marketing, channel and value-added resellers, new products, and our acquisition of Fuze, Inc. may not result in meeting our revenue or operating margin targets we forecast in our guidance, for a particular quarter or for the full fiscal year. Our increased emphasis on profitability and cash flow generation may not be successful. The reduction in our total costs as a percentage of revenue may negatively impact our revenue and our business in ways we do not anticipate and may not achieve the desired outcome. For a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, see \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, as well as other reports that 8x8, Inc. files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement, and 8x8, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement for any reason, except as required by law, even as new information becomes available or other events occur in the future. Explanation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation The Company has provided in this release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage, and evaluate the business, and to make operating decisions. Management believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating the Company's ongoing operational performance. Management also believes that some of 8x8\u2019s investors use these Non-GAAP financial measures as an additional tool in evaluating 8x8's ongoing \"core operating performance\" in the ordinary, ongoing, and customary course of the Company's operations. Core operating performance excludes items that are non-cash, not expected to recur, or not reflective of ongoing financial results. Management also believes that looking at the Company\u2019s core operating performance provides consistency in period-to-period comparisons and trends. These Non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies, which limits the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes. Management recognizes that these Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, including the fact that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of items to exclude from the Non-GAAP financial information. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the table titled \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\". Detailed explanations of the adjustments from comparable GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures are as follows: Non-GAAP Costs of Revenue, Costs of Service Revenue and Costs of Other Revenue Non-GAAP Costs of Revenue includes: (i) Non-GAAP Cost of Service Revenue, which is Cost of Service Revenue excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, certain legal and regulatory costs, and certain severance, transition and contract exit costs; and (ii) Non-GAAP Cost of Other Revenue, which is Cost of Other Revenue excluding stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, certain legal and regulatory costs, and certain severance, transition and contract exit costs. Non-GAAP Service Revenue Gross Margin, Other Revenue Gross Margin, and Total Revenue Gross Margin Non-GAAP Service Revenue Gross Profit and Margin as a percentage of Service Revenue and Non-GAAP Other Revenue Gross Profit and Margin as a percentage of Other Revenue are computed as Service Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Service Revenue divided by Service Revenue and Other Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Other Revenue divided by Other Revenue, respectively. Non-GAAP Total Revenue Gross Profit and Margin as a percentage of Total Revenue is computed as Total Revenue less Non-GAAP Cost of Service Revenue and Non-GAAP Cost of Other Revenue divided by Total Revenue. Management believes the Company\u2019s investors benefit from understanding these adjustments and from an alternative view of the Company\u2019s Cost of Service Revenue and Cost of Other Revenue, as well as the Company's Service, Other and Total Revenue Gross Margin performance compared to prior periods and trends. Non-GAAP Operating Profit and Non-GAAP Operating Margin Non-GAAP Operating Profit excludes: amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, certain legal and regulatory costs, and certain severance, transition, and contract exit costs from Operating Profit (Loss). Non-GAAP Operating Margin is Non-GAAP Operating Profit divided by Revenue. Management believes that these exclusions provide investors with a supplemental view of the Company\u2019s ongoing operating performance. Non-GAAP Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA Non-GAAP Net Income excludes: amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, certain legal and regulatory costs, certain severance, transition and contract exit costs, amortization of debt discount and issuance cost, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, gain or loss on remeasurement of warrants, gain or loss on sale of assets, and other income. Adjusted EBITDA excludes interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization of capitalized internal use software, and other income (expense), net from non-GAAP net income. Management believes the Company\u2019s investors benefit from understanding these adjustments and an alternative view of our net income performance as compared to prior periods and trends. Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share \u2013 Basic and Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share - Diluted Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share \u2013 Basic is Non-GAAP Net Income divided by the weighted-average basic shares outstanding. Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share \u2013 Diluted is Non-GAAP Net Income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. Diluted shares outstanding include the effect of potentially dilutive securities from stock-based benefit plans and convertible senior notes. These potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of net loss per share attributable to common stockholders on a GAAP basis because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. They are added for the computation of diluted net income per share on a non-GAAP basis in periods when 8x8 has net profit on a non-GAAP basis as their inclusion provides a better indication of 8x8\u2019s underlying business performance. Management believes the Company\u2019s investors benefit by understanding our Non-GAAP net income performance as reflected in a per share calculation as ways of measuring performance by ownership in the Company. Management believes these adjustments offer investors a useful view of the Company\u2019s diluted net income per share as compared to prior periods and trends. Management evaluates and makes decisions about its business operations based on Non-GAAP financial information by excluding items management does not consider to be \u201ccore costs\u201d or \u201ccore proceeds.\u201d Management believes some of its investors also evaluate our \"core operating performance\" as a means of evaluating our performance in the ordinary, ongoing, and customary course of our operations. Management excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets, which primarily represents a non-cash expense of technology and/or customer relationships already developed, to provide a supplemental way for investors to compare the Company\u2019s operations pre-acquisition to those post-acquisition and to those of our competitors that have pursued internal growth strategies. Stock-based compensation expense has been excluded because it is a non-cash expense and relies on valuations based on future conditions and events, such as the market price of 8x8 common stock, that are difficult to predict and/or largely not within the control of management. The related employer payroll taxes for stock-based compensation are excluded since they are incurred only due to the associated stock-based compensation expense. Acquisition and integration expenses consist of external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition and strategic investment activities such as legal and other professional services, due diligence, integration, and other closing costs, which are costs that vary significantly in amount and timing. Legal and regulatory costs include litigation and other professional services, as well as certain tax and regulatory liabilities. Severance, transition and contract exit costs include employee termination benefits, executive severance agreements, and cancellation of certain contracts. Debt amortization expenses relate to the non-cash accretion of the debt discount. 8x8, INC.

        "Extracted Text": "KEY POINTS ...or is the low stock price an open invitation to pick up some deeply discounted shares? Let's find out. I have a history of being bullish about cloud-based communications veteran 8x8 (EGHT 6.90%). In fact, I have liked the entire sector for years. A breakthrough in the high-volume mainstream always hovered just beyond the horizon. The benefits of low-cost voice calls, conducted over the open internet with a plethora of built-in extra features, were surely destined to result in incredible business growth. Well, 8x8 just reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Let me take this opportunity to review where 8x8 stands today and where the company may go from here. First, here are the raw numbers. Total revenue fell 1.8% year over year, landing at $181 million. Your average Wall Street analyst expected approximately $183.5 million. Oops. Well, times are tough -- a small sales dip might be OK. What else? On the bottom line, 8x8's adjusted earnings nearly doubled from $0.07 to $0.12 per share. Here, the analyst consensus stopped at $0.10 per share. All right, not too shabby. The company's management team has a favorite non-traditional metric called cash flow from operations per share. On that note, 8x8's operating cash flow rose from $15.5 million to $22.4 million -- a 45% jump. But the share count increased by 4% over the same period, so that coveted per-share reading of operating cash flows rose by a somewhat milder 39%. The company seems to do just fine in terms of important profit metrics. But how did 8x8 deliver these solid numbers? It looks like an effective cost-cutting program. For instance, the third-quarter budget for research and development decreased by $1.8 million, or 5%. Sales and marketing costs fell by $11.8 million, or 15%. Uh-oh. Those are the costs I would like to see stablize or rise in any tech company worth its salt, even in a challenging market. Today's research is the lifeblood of tomorrow's business growth, and that marketing budget comes in handy for finding new customers. But 8x8 is slashing these expenses, and not by a little. A quick look at the long-term trends confirms it. 8X8 essentially gave up on its long-term growth ambitions over the last year. R&D expenses have been trending downward since the end of calendar year 2022. The sales and marketing downtrend started in the following quarter: EGHT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE (QUARTERLY) DATA BY YCHARTS But wait -- the lower expenses lead to higher cash profits. That has to be good, right? Unfortunately, I'm not terribly excited about the company's plans for that extra cash. 8X8 is boosting its operating cash flow in order to facilitate debt repayments. CEO Sam Wilson certainly spun the debt payments as a positive trend for shareholders. \"We are aggressively delevering on our way to creating a fortress balance sheet,\" Wilson said in the earnings call. \"All things being equal, this should drive increased shareholder value as a greater proportion of our enterprise value accrues to our equity holders.\" Fair enough, I suppose. With $274 million of long-term debt and $169.5 million in cash equivalents on the balance sheet, the net debt accounts for roughly 14% of 8x8's enterprise value -- arguably the most complete measurement of any company's total market value. Lifting that weight should bring some relief to the stock price. Still, I'm not convinced that this is 8x8's best way to create shareholder value. I would have preferred share buybacks or maybe even dividends, or -- even better -- simply leaving the extra cash committed to more and better R&D efforts. All things considered, the main takeaway from this review was that the stock is down for good reason. 8x8's market cap peaked at $4.1 billion three years ago, and share prices are down more than 90% from the record highs. The mixed third-quarter report didn't really move 8x8's needle, and management's business review would have sounded more appropriate coming from a small bank than a growth-oriented tech expert. So now I know why 8x8 and its much larger rival, RingCentral (NYSE: RNG), are the only pure-play cloud communications specialists left standing. Telecom infrastructure giant LM Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) bought Vonage for $6.2 billion in the summer of 2022. magicJack VocalTec took the private equity exit in 2018 for a mere $143 million. And after a couple of chained buyouts starting in 2014, Cbeyond has been a subsidiary of financial giant Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) since 2022. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised to see 8x8 seeking a similar exit ramp. Buyout speculation is not my favorite investing strategy, especially if the potential buyout target might have to go through a bankruptcy protection process before finding a new parent company. The times, they are a-changing. Cloud communications with a voice-call focus don't seem so hot anymore, given the wide availability of cheap or free calling platforms with high-definition video and other bonus features. 8x8 may trade at bargain-bin valuation ratios like 6 times free cash flows and 0.6 times sales today, but those low multiples don't always highlight a deeply discounted value play. In this case, they look like red flags instead. I'm giving up on cloud-based communications in general, and 8x8 in particular, until further notice.

        "Extracted Text": "A mixed earnings report wasn't enough to support the cloud communications expert's surging share prices -- so here's a quick market correction. Shares of cloud-based communications specialist 8x8 (EGHT 6.90%) crashed as much as 22.2% on Friday morning on the heels of a disappointing earnings report. At noon EDT, the stock had recovered to a 16% daily decline. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, 8x8 saw total sales rising 19% to $79.3 million. Adjusted net losses stopped at $0.03 per diluted share, down from $0.05 of positive earnings per share in the year-ago period. Analysts' consensus estimates had called for breakeven earnings on roughly $77 million in top-line revenue, so this was a mixed performance. Looking ahead, management issued full-year revenue guidance for the next fiscal year just above the current Street view. IMAGE SOURCE: 8X8, INC. Analyst firm BofA/Merrill lowered 8x8 from a buy to a hold in the wake of this report while Baird kept its outperform rating on the stock and called this plunge a buying opportunity. Both analyst firms raised their price targets on the stock, landing at $22 per share for the bearish firm and $24 per share for the more bullish Baird analyst. This was actually a solid report and 8x8 is going strong. CEO Vik Verma called this a \"transformational year.\" The company's client list is starting to skew toward larger companies now, driving gross margins higher and customer churn lower. The earnings miss resulted from a 38% year-over-year increase in sales and marketing expenses that should help keep the top-line growth going for the long haul. But the stock entered this earnings report on a full head of steam, having gained 57% in 2018 and 68% over the previous 52 weeks. Call this a correction and feel free to take Baird's advice about a buy-in opportunity here. Anders Bylund has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

These tools can roughly be divided into indicators and chart patterns. When trying to make a 8x8 stock forecast, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall. Moving averages are among the most popular 8x8 stock prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for EGHT stock over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for EGHT is a sum of EGHT\u2019s closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12. In addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action. 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the stock market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the 8x8 stock price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for 8x8 stock. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually interpreted as a negative forecast for the EGHT market. Traders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the 8x8 stock price. When making a 8x8 stock forecast, most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of 8x8 stock with different granularity \u2013 for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremely short-term price action or choose a weekly candlestick chart to identify long-terms trends. 1-hour, 4-hour and 1-day candlestick charts are among the most popular. Let\u2019s use a 1-hour candlestick chart as an example of how this type of price chart gives us information about opening and closing prices. The chart is divided into \u201ccandles\u201d that give us information about 8x8\u2019s stock price action in 1-hour chunks. Each candlestick will display EGHT\u2019s opening price, closing price, as well as the highest and lowest prices that 8x8 reached within the 1-hour period. This information makes it easier to make an informed price prediction. It\u2019s also important to pay attention to the color of the candle \u2013 a green candle means that the closing price was higher than the opening price, while a red candle tells us the opposite. Some charts will use hollow and filled candlestick bodies instead of colors to represent the same thing. Just like with any other asset, the price action of 8x8 stock is driven by supply and demand. These dynamics can be influenced by fundamental factors, such as earnings announcements, new product launches, acquisitions and mergers, and other factors. The EGHT stock price can also be influenced by market sentiment, broader economic conditions, interest rates, inflation rates and political developments. Some traders try to identify candlestick patterns when making stock price predictions to try and get an edge over the competition. Some candlestick formations are seen as likely to forecast bullish price action, while others are seen as bearish.
